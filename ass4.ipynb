    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

aware that we have a missouri noodlers associationcnn sent a young reporter to interview the president of the missouri noodlers association who immediately became my new hero because for his interview

convent hiding behind tombstones from the nazisand then when the golf cart guy shines his flashlight just for my own amusement im gonna pop out from behind it and go dont do it ralph youre not one of them dont take us come with us and then im gonna laugh and laugh he wont laugh but i dont care its not the point im gonna laugh and then im gonna run by him mom and im gonna run away and im gonna make it over the whole border of the villages im gonna make it to freedom anddo you know how i know im confident i can do that because im the only person out of  that has both of their real knees mom i am the usain bolt of this community i dont think youre respecting my powersprepared to getting older theres moments where youre hanging out with them and youre like wow are you actually going crazy in front of me like should i call someone i dont know what to doi was in target with my mom she opened her wallet and all her credit cards were individually wrapped in tin foil she unwraps one and hands it to me as if thats a completely normal exchange of information i go were not gonna talk about thatshe goes talk about what kathleeni go the tin foil mom the tin foilshe goes well obviously you have not been keeping up with the newsi said no i actually thought i had beenwell then you must have missed the story about the raygun peoplewho are the raygun peopleshe said well your father and i saw it on  or  or  minutes whatever those serious it was a very serious program there are people now kathleen with computer rayguns and they can shoot that raygun through my purse through my wallet and they gather all of your personal information off of that strip on the back of your debit card they can shoot through your fathers ass at a gas station right through his ass into his walleti went okay my moms not stupid she was a nurse for a million years so i called my friend in boston whos been a cop forever and i asked him about the raygun people and told him about the tin foilhe said two things kathleen number one no i have not heard about the raygun people but in fairness to your mom i havent checked my work email in three days now number two and more importantly what i do know from being a cop for  years is that crazy people love tin foil you dont need to tell your mother im just telling you so you know that is a fact an old cop told me that always carry tin foil in your squad car if you come across someone whos mentally ill and having a psychotic break or maybe someone in a drug frenzy you just tear off a piece of tin foil you calmly walk over and go make a hat and the whole situationthey drive to florida cause my mom wont fly anymore the fear of flying has literally gone over the edge with her it started years agoand i do feel sorry for people who have that fear cause it

point where the experts were like building paper airplanes going okay heres what i think happened all rightit was windy come on turn on the fan stay with me bobsomebody put water in the trash can thats my ocean come onbut i watched it because every day they would go live to the city of kuala lumpur to a hilton hotel for a press conference from the malaysian airlines spokesmani have never felt so sorry for any individual in their jobbecause every day he had no new informationand he had to face a ballroom full of chinese peoplecause there were  missing people most were chinesetheir families have been flown in he couldnt even make eye contacthe would just come out and go br ah ha yeahwell uh once again i have new no information on flight its a very bad situationwe cannot find our airplanewe have called australiatheyre gonna help us look for our airplanesometimes you lose somethingyou cant find it and you have to ask for helphey have you seen my keysthats the kind of situationsorrythen he would leaveim like this is a real airline theyre open today i check every day i google this is a real working airlineand the chinese people were so kind i thought like in patienthe would come out day after daytheres nothing there was very little reactionweek three he came outah br ah yeah once again i have no new information on flight we still cannot find our airplane its a really really really bad situation we do know this now though we have been looking in the wrong ocean ha hawhat whatwhat whatah yeah that ocean wrong maybe now over here were gonna look over here in this oceanwhatthe wrong oceanthat is an acceptable statement in the year  regarding a boati dont know where it went man i told you the world was flat maybe it just fell off i dont knowthat is not an acceptable statement in the year  unbelievableand once again the chinese people they just didnt really reactand i thought oh my god thats thats the day where my irish temper every every single valve would have bursti couldve had a can of aqua net and a lighter and that man would have burst into a pillar of firea biblical pillar of fire on cnn internationaland i wouldve done it knowing full well im gonna be arrested and tried for murder which wouldve been fineand i would say yes please let me take the witness standcause i dont care what question im asked i have a twoword answermiss madigan is it true that you took aqua net and a lighter into the ballroomhuh wrong ocean hawrong oceanunbelievablethe chinese people though are still pretty kindday  for those of you who are not obsessed with missing airplanes um thats the last day of hope because the ping device can no longer possibly operatetheres the black box and then theres a ping thing that emits a sonar soundnow this is assuming one had put batteries in their ping deviceyeah google thisabout five months ago they had a little secret announcement cause they thought everybody forgotah yeah one more thing ha ha about that airplane um we never had batteries in that yeah sorry well you know sometimes at home your remote control your batteries go dead and you go to a different remote control and you take those batteries and you put em in this remote control and then later on you go for the other old one you go uhoh i forgot thats what happened sorrythey are openso day at the time the chinese people dont know that theres they dont know theres no batteries they believe there were batteries in ithe comes out and i thought whatever you do just dont say it the same way phrase it differently no nohe came out brah ha yeah once again i have no new information on flight and finally the chinese people lost their mindsan old man like rolls back flicked a lit cigarette at that mans head live on tvsadly my first thought was wow you can still smoke inside in a hilton in malaysianote to self vacation in kuala lumpurtake different airline check southwest that airlines ridiculousand then the older women started losing itlike literally having heart attacks  is being called its bedlamthey have finally reached their maximum potential of patiencetheyre out of iti happen to be home watching it with my parentsmy dad who does not like public displays of emotion was like oh my god jesus christ they got to get it together they got to get it together do they know theyre on television are',\n",
       "  ' they aware that people can seemy mom interrupts with and i have six siblingswell jack you have to understand its extra sad for the chinese people because they only have one childi go hold on a second so are you saying mom it would only be a seventh as sad if i went missing foreveryes thats what im saying yes you may not wanna hear that but thats the truth i mean we have six other children they have children your father and i have casino buffet tickets we are leading a full lifeyes you areseven kids its too manynobody notices though thats a good thingif youre one of seven no one notices anythinglike im surprised i have friends who have one or two kidsthey speak to them about their feelings and their thoughts and they address them individuallycause my friends are like oh you guys didnt nono not with seven kidsthere were just announcements made thats allwere moving oh fuck what what what whenyour mothers already in the car i dont know whats going on with you peoplenobody notices when youre one of sevenwhich was fine with me i didnt mind that i would still choose thatbut sometimes to the point of really guysi do not watch myself on tvi was  years old and i walked into my parents house and they somehow had me on their tv and i looked at it and i go ah what is wrong with my eyemy dad goes you mean your lazy onewhatwhat yeah your right eyewhen you get tired or nervous it twitches and kind of jumps aroundyou you dont feel that happeningno no i didnt know i didnt know that was happening how long has that been going oni mean since you were a baby i mean they uh told us to put a patch on you but you cant have a baby girl pirate thats crazy so uh we thought youd grow out of it quite frankly and clearly you have not kathleen so if i were you before you go on television i would get a nap or calm down cause itsi didnt really know how small families worked till i got to go over to other friends houseswhen youre in second grade or whatever my friend across the street bob he would say thats my mom and thats my sisterand im like well where is everyone like i dont wanna say anythingmaybe there was a house fire or you know some sort of tragedybut this is weirdi think smaller families are kinder they say kinder thingsi dont know if they mean them but i heard i love you a loti love you love you too love you more than yesterdayha love you more than tomorrow and its not even todayi would just stand there paralyzed and uncomfortableyou guys dont say i love you nothere are nine people in my housesaying i love you would be a sign of weaknessthey need to wake up and wonder how i feel about their assim not giving them thatand at this age if i walked into a room and all my siblings were sitting there and they started to say i love you id run out because i would know this is some sort of intervention and im not falling for that im not listening to your dumbass sad letterdear kathleenwe went to catholic schoolsuh yeah i didnt mind whooif i had kids i would make them go to a catholic school cause ill tell you the one thing i guarantee you if you send your kids to a catholic school they will never join isissomebody wouldve said to me at age  after all that catholicism hey could we talk to you about our religion for a minuteha ha ha ha ha hano you may not you are  years late to this party muhammad youi think being catholic is christian but its been pointed out to me many times in the south that theyre not the samecause in the south theyll go oh are you christianill go yeah im catholic oh well were christianoh okay i thought we said the same thing but i guess notthere are differencesthe christians have a direct relationship with jesus they speak of it like thatyou know what me and my relationship with jesus i love jesus jesus loves meits a direct very solid relationship with jesusand i thought wow really you guys go straight to jesusin a catholic school i was given a laundry list of people to contact before the nuns said because otherwise im bothering jesusyou are gonna call these people kathleen before you bother jesus you could start with your guardian angel hes got nothing to do  hours a day except tend to your needs if hes not available you can speak to the saint in charge of the activity youre upset about every single saint has been assigned an assignment you can speak to jesus mother if youd like to you can give mary a shout but you are not to bother jesusokeydokeyeven if i did something bad i couldnt tell jesusi had to go to confessioni had to get in a creepy closet with a guy in the darkand then i had to tell him and hes gonna tell a guyand i wasnt good at confession because my dad for many years was a defense attorneyand starting in second grade he would tell us all at the dinner table i want all of you kids to remember if the police capture you or anyone in a position of authority ask you questions your response no matter what are i do not recall i need an attorney i do not recall i need an attorney ninety percent of people are in prison because they cant keep their goddamn mouths shut never ever snitch on yourselfand then i would go to confession in the closet and the priest would go kathleen have you done anything badis there anything youd like to tell me aboutim not falling for this my dads probably planted him herei know i know what im supposed to sayim sorry father but i do not recall and i need an attorneyhoney youre only in second gradewell maybe you dont know this father anthony but  of people are in prison because ',\n",

we got hit so hard i actually flew to a better seat than id originally securedwhos got the window now jackassthats rightand that was with my parents chainsmoking in the car both of emit was so smoky in that caryou could barely see other passengers seriouslythey way way back was like studio  because the sun would hit the smoke and create patterns and then i would draw patterns within the pattern because i didnt have an ipad so thats what i would do to entertain myselfif youre a woman and youre gonna install a car seat i would highly suggest you put on a sports bra cause youre gonna get hotyoure gonna be so hot youre gonna start inadvertently just tearing off pieces of clothingand if youre not careful youll end up like i did in my sisters driveway in my regular bra just drinking a beer staring off into spaceand the normally very friendly neighbors came home im trying to talk to emi dont know why theyre being so weirdand im like how you guys doing yeah i know i just came home she had twins i need two of these i cant cant figure it out im so hot im so hot i would offer you a beer but i only have three left and ive made no progresoi just found notes on the backtheres factory notes that say if you dont know how to do this you can take it to the police or the fire department and theyll install it for youbut unfortunately i didnt find those notes till after i already started drinkingso i dont think it would be a good idea to drive to law enforcement shitfaced and two car seats and i dont have any babiesi mean its just too much to explain rightcrazyso this was what i was thinkingi was thinking i might set her car on fireno call the fire department and then after they put the car out i go hey since youre all here do you think you can give me a hookup yeahtheyre a pain

the luggagetheyre just everywhereand i went to the gift shop on the way out because i wanted to get watertheres a girl working in the gift shop shes about  years oldi said hey im not from here whats

those two things interest you but they are fresh outit is not a healthy placethats why i feel at home there and thats why i like it thereits sort of the gist they just dont really truly give a shiton a good level in a healthy way theyve decided to not be healthyi was in a pub i ordered roast beef with mashed potatoes cause i love that and i thought im going to ask probably the answer is no but ithe guy was like  the bartenderand i go hey do you guys by any chance have any cornyou wouldve thought i asked for an eightball of cocaineihe goes corn no we wouldnt have any corn here in the countryside we probably dont have any corn in the entire country at the momenti said have you ever had cornyes ive had corn when i was nine we traveled to germany and i had some corn and i didnt care for iti was like good for you he hasnt had corn in  years and he doesnt give a shit and he looks fine and hes bartending on a thursdaythe whole pace of ireland is just slower but i like it betterit just takes you a while in your american mind to slow down like thati went cause they dontits very nobodys really you know fired up on iti went in a store that said bagels in a little town in the countryi walked in theres a ladyand theres a glass case and theres no bagelsand i thought here we go righti go you dont have anyi thought maybe they were in the back you dont have any bagelsno im afraid we wouldnt have any bagels at the momentare you selling any other food right nowno i wouldnt be selling anything but the bagels and i dont have at the momentits at that point your american brain wants to go what the fuck is wrong with you peoplebut i would never do that cause im midwest politei i said uh what can i ask you a question why are you still open cause you have nothing for saleshe goes i left the door open first of all i dont know where the bagels are theyre supposed to be here half past  its half past  i dont know perhaps theres been an accident on the road youll say a

if people didnt eat all their pizza theyd put it back out on the buffet and that would shut down any normal business and with chuck e cheese they have thrived i mean when i read the story i was like i thought thats what they were doing i thought we agreed thats fine i didnt know what the article was aboutour daughter still sleeps in our bed too and parents dont like that when you say it theyre like you gotta keep them outside dont look at them uh its my fault so we had a kid late in life we have one kid so were hitting all the sights and id be when i travel a bunch and id get home id want us to sleep in the bed together and ive built up a habit now its happened so its tough though because kids dont know how to sleep i mean she makes a king bed feel like a twin i mean im on the edge when i sleep alone in a hotel i sleep with my head on the nightstand its the only way i know how to go to bed she gets sideways upside down if you woke up upside down tomorrow you would go to the hospitalshes also apparently going through menopause cause shes the hottest human being thats ever lived im freezing at night she kicks all the covers off youre like yeah you go ahead its your bed were lucky to be in itshes gotta get out at some point you know i dont know shell be  years old hey can i get in the bed with you guys her kids are upstairs asleep in their bed her husband left a while ago he aint gonna put up with thatum i remember id fall out of a bunk bed i slept in a bunk bed i was on the top bunk and i would get over a railing and just fall six feet to the ground and just land i mean you dont catch yourself its just whatever hits first all your body weight just lands on your head i got a fullblown concussion im crying my parents are like just go back to a deep sleep for seven hoursive had three concussions in my life and none of them because of sports just living life man you know stuff happens to your head what are you going to do one was in high school i got pushed into a wall headfirst and it took them three class periods to figure out i had a concussion thats how much i was bringing to the table i mean two teachers didnt even notice and the third one was like he wasnt facing forward and thats when i realized hes one of the better facerforwards ive ever had so i knewmy biggest concussion was when i was  years old i fell down a cliff so i grew up in old hickory tennessee and we used to climb down this cliff into old hickory lake and wed done it a ton of times and so one day i slip and fall so my friend that im with he goes and gets my mom there was a guy fishing in a boat down in the lake and so he sees me and he gets me into the boat he takes me over to some stairs which he had to be like why didnt he just use these stairs they were right next to that cliff  it didnt even make sense uh there was two guys at the bottom of the steps and he goes this kid fell can you carry him up so they carry me up and now my moms in an ambulance in her pajamas my dad who i think everybody knows now is a magician and hes doing a show in a full tuxedo so they get to the hospital the doctor starts talking to my parents i mean my mom looks homeless my dads in a tuxedo it looks it looks like theyre divorced and someones not paying child supportso weve never known who was in the boat or the guys that carried me up the stairs weve never known who it was and we always wanted to thank them those guys truly saved my life and we could just never find out who it was so we never knew so i tell you that to tell you uh last year my dad is doing a show he does these magic shows in prisons so hes doing a show at a prison and during the show one of the inmates just stands up and says i know your son which is probably not the best place as a father to hear that just like i know your boy he keeps his mouth shut hes good people  so my dad he goes hey all right how do you know my son and he was one of the guys that carried me up those stairs that day i mean i promise i was  years old and wed never known who carried me up those stairs and it was him and his brother and then his brother saw me on the tonight show and was like thats that kid we carried up those stairs that day so its pretty crazy so since then ive been actually bringing him out to shows im gonna bring him out tonight and no hes not here hes in prison but you know sorry yeah trust me look he would love to be here trust me uh i mean yeah hed kill to be here to be honest but theres one day one day ill get him i did find out why he was in prison which was crazy so it was that same day so they just carried a body down those stairs and you can imagine the frustration to then be handed another body yeah and youre like dude are you serious like we just did this man you know all right that part i made up but the rest i swear the rest of it is trueour daughter is in third grade and for first grade she started taking the bus and it was the first time she ever took the bus so you know as a parent you walk them to the bus stop its very fun so we got her on the bus she went to school at',\n",
       "  ' the end of the day someone from school called my cell phone they have my wifes cell phone they have my cell phone they called my cell phone and she said do you know what bus number your daughters supposed to be on and i said im her dad as in are you cra i was like this is how you thought youd get this information was to call the dad you saw mom and dads cell phone you go i bet the dad knows i was like do you have parents you ever seen a family before you thought lets call the husband unless theres two husbands you should never call a husband a day in your life id rather you ask a lady that doesnt know her i think she could get to the bottom of it quicker than i can i had to go get her all right ill come get her tell me the name of the school and ill come get her where does she gowhen you pack lunches now you got to be careful cause a lot of kids have peanut allergies now and our daughter actually has a cashew allergy with tree nuts and so i dont know what tree nuts are but it could kill my daughter the doctor goes cant have tree nuts and thats it he left and i was like wed love to know i didnt know where nuts came from but apparently they come from two different places and one of thems a treei feel bad look i want to defend all these kids with peanut allergies i dont think they get defended they get yelled at by adults we got a lot of adults addicted to peanuts in this country and theyre furious i havent had peanuts in forever you take peanuts out of my life i dont think id notice and we just have adults are yelling at these children like they chose it like when they were born the doctor goes hey wanna be a nightmare to everybody every scenario is life and death you ever been on a plane they just announce it these planes just serve pretzels and be done with it but they try every flight and if they cant they just go all right everybody cant have peanuts today cause of that loser kid right there and these grownups are booing him the only reason im on the flight is for the peanuts i dont even know where its goingwere doing homework too our daughter started bringing it home homeworks fun first and second grade was awesome third grade youre like okay they throw some stuff in youre like oh all right all right its uh okay learning it earlier than we used to huh i dont even know if thats true but she brought home common core math thats fun its a new math they invented no heads up just give it to parents that never learned it uh its just a whole new i mean its unbelievable they bring it home you gotta watch a  youtube video on common core math i dont even understand it if you know it if you dont know common core its just a new math and the goal of common core is to use one sheet of paper for every problem you you just want to keep breaking the problem down you put the problem at the top and it just keeps going and then whats even funnier is you see old math in the middle of it as you break it down old math gets in there and youre like oh just do that at the top i dont even know what were doing its not like old math isnt working old math still i dont get incorrect change everywhere just going this stupid old mathits a long way to get at the same answer i told my wife it feels like if you knocked on my front door and i opened it and you say can i come in and i was like do you mind coming in through the back door does the front door not work no it works i use it a lot of people still use it but the new way is to go jump the fence and come in the back and meet me at this same spoteven though i make fun of common core i have learned stuff from elementary homework which is embarrassing im  my daughter is eight nothing should ever come out of her mouth that im like what what was that i learned when to use a or an in a sentence  i didnt know that there was a rule in play i thought you felt it out you know and just go that feels right and thats what you do i do the same thing with a comma ive never known where a commas supposed to go if i feel a commas coming i try to get out of that sentence so bad i mean i and if i cant i just put a comma and see if someone says something you know theyre like is that a comma im like is it my comma button has been sticking on my phoneuh i remember nothing from school people talk about history to me im like i dont know when you guys learned that i think we skipped all of this i almost didnt graduate high school i had an f in science i was taking a class called science my senior year in high school i mean i had an f my dad went and talked to the teacher and said look just give him a d hes not gonna do science stuff and the teacher agreed to it she was that confident i wouldnt touch the science world i got we took acts and i got a  on it and if you dont know acts  is like thats not good man but you made it seventeen theyre like i dont even are you enrolled in this school like what are you doingthe only thing i remember is in seventh grade we had a kid fistfight our pe teacher that stuck with me he was too old to be in seventh grade he drove to seventh grade if youre a seventh grade teacher and one of the kids drives you just know you gotta fight that kid one day theres its just happening like you people always talk to me very easy too or dumb if i talk to a stranger i can always feel it and i think its my eyes i have big eyes you know and so i just get a lot of you still with me man and im just sitting there like yeah man im listening he goes it felt l',\n",
       "  'ike you couldve been anywhere you knowi got a reversible jacket at home and i have two of them cause i didnt know it was reversible bought them at the same time tried them both on separately liked the black one thought might as well get the blue one too went and laid them up there and i remember they go are you sure i go yeah i think i know what im doing here all rightthe dumbest ive ever been talked to i like to golf and so a guy was telling me theres a real golf course in north carolina where llamas are the caddies so if you dont know anything about golf a caddy usually carries your bag around tells you how far you are from the hole helps you out so this course they have llamas so you put your golf bag on a llama and it carries your bag so he told me that and then he looks into my big dumb eyes and he goes just so you know llamas cant talk though i mean thats the question he was trying to get ahead of as he looked into my stupid eyes like he just im going to say it so that guy doesnt have to say it im just at the zoo talking to the giraffes hey where you guys from you know i know where youre from but where are you from fromim gonna let this one go by you know the hard part is i see them coming before yall and i just see a blinking light like five miles away going that one looks like its coming in my head in my head im just like i think its you know couple times ive looked and it was just stars uh honestly i look up and ill be like that ones not moving that quick uh feel like ones just sitting on top of us youre like ah its the moon is ituh so im  years old and when i turned   was the first age i did not want to turn i remember my parents turning  it just feels old and its also the age that you do realize everybody youre talking to you are older than before youre  i think everybody you talk to is your age and for some reason when you turn  youre just older than that ill be talking to them like remember that it was   i wasnt born yet youre like golly are you serious dude in my eyes we look the same wheres your dad at let me talk to him cause i swear i thought you were my ageone thing i got when i hit my forties was claustrophobia never had it actually got it here on the simpsons ride which is whats crazy i mean were  yards away from where my life fell apart i rode that ride with my daughter and were sitting on it and theres we had another buddy and he has his two girls on so we sit there and they pull the bar down and the bar my leg gets stuck in the middle and it just opened a door that i never knew was there i mean its just it is like a problem i had to stop the ride its super embarrassing to stop a childs ride and just be like im just waving like i cant do it then they open the bar and go you can do it again i was like im out and just no one got to ride it cause i couldnt ride it we all had to leave yeah ruined it for everybody uh and thats claustrophobia just kind of ruins everybodys timeits the whats funny the panic of claustrophobia is pretty funny though its not funny when its happening to you but how quick you go from normal to just an insane person is just its all at the same time so its all kind of new to me so i forget i have it and ill put myself in a situation and i go there it is i got in an uber once with like seven people we get in i go ill get in the third row try to be a good guy i climb in the back they put all the seats up and it just starts hitting me im back there like  just trying to be normal you know not talking then you go hey you think you can roll the window down you know what can everybody just get out of the van real fast  just were just driving down the interstate could yall crack the window do you mind if i drive the uber you think i could drive itso i was born in  and the reason i say that cause if you are my age or just right around my age very like maybe  to  you might realize or maybe you dont know ive never been called a millennial or generation x id never even really heard any of those terms growing up and now you hear them all the time so i looked it up to see i was like what am i and im technically nothing im on a cusp im a generation gap and what we are called xennials or were called the oregon trail generation or were called my favorite name is the lucky ones and its true were very lucky we actually grew up in two different worlds when i was a kid i grew up like it was the  you would go outside and your parents just didnt know where you were we went to school and played oregon trail on a computer at school no one had a computer at home what are you a zillionaire like i mean you couldnt but then in high school i had aol we had a computer at home then i got a beeper and then i got a cellphone i didnt have social media until i was  with myspace you know i mean social media like whatever i did in high schools a rumor it cant ruin my lifeso if youre around my age you might realize you end up always being in the middle like i understand when a genxer says something youre like i get it a millennial says something i get it you always feel in the middle and these groups all hate each other the most ive ever felt where i was in the middle is just this one hotel that i stayed at so a lot of hotels now they have chromecast and you can watch netflix in your hotel room so im watching i get in my room and i turn it on my chromecast is not working so i called down to the front desk and the oldest voice i ever heard answered the phone this gu',\n",
       "  'y was a civil war survivor i mean he he was the age where you just go thank you for your service like was he in the army youre like probably man theres an age where they all had to go at that age so just say it uh so i tell him hey my chromecast is not working i couldve just made up a word hes never heard of that i could have said my beepbop broke i mean he asked if i was staying at that hotel thats how confused he goes are you staying here i was like do you think ive called a front desk from a different hotel room so he goes look i dont know what this is but theres a younger guy here ill send him up hell help you and i was like great so that guy comes up and he knocks on my door i open it hes my dads age right when i see him youre like all right dude we dont have to do this you know i mean i know youve heard of it but if i cant fix it youre not gonna be able to fix it but hes the generation that still wants to give it a try so i gotta let him in so he comes in my room sits on my bed a little too far back i thought uh i just remember the back of his calves were touching the bed and i was like are your feet dangling how far back are you gonna go uh are you cold do you want some covers man he gets the remote and just starts pressing all the buttons i said i dont know if thatll do it he goes lets just keep trying it though i go all right uh  ill turn the shower on open a window lets try everything lets just see maybe it turns on who knows maybe its all connected we cant get it and he goes all right theres a younger guy hes about to come to work at this point im like im the younger guy i was like its all right dude i dont need it he goes no its a millennial and i was like now were getting somewhere you know this is what the millennial does he was born with technology hell know how to fix this i was excited i was like great he goes he comes to work in an hour i go wonderful let me tell you know how quick that millennial fixed it ill never know cause he just didnt come to work that night so didnt call in nothing i found out cause the old guy called me cause he was supposed to fill in for him he was furious dude he hates that millennial he goes he never comes to work he doesnt take it serious hes got a peanut allergy i was like all right well i ended up fixing it myself because it was just unplugged so yeah thats my fault uh the next morning i dealt with my daughters generation which is a generation that i feel like just thinks about themselves you know and so i go down to breakfast they have the breakfast buffet were all going through it this little girls in front of me and she has waffles so she gets a waffle and theres a coffee pot worth of syrup sitting on a plate so you pour it and you leave it back on the plate and then you go and eat your breakfast so she gets the syrup and she just takes it to her table so now the syrups gone and i see this happen but no one else does so im hearing people go through and asking where the syrups at its starting to become a problem people are like wheres the syrup the hotels like i dont know thats all the syrup we have was out there i know where its at but im not trying to get involved i didnt wake up and think i hope i get to talk to everybody this morning when you roll out of bed youre not like i hope im about to get in the thick of it down there so im just trying to say stuff as i walk by people maybe someone took it to their table look around maybe i just like keep going you see that little girls table over there maybe they have itand no ones picking up on this so i just have to go get it this girls sitting with a bunch of her friends so i go over to them and i was like hey can we get that syrup back thats kind of for the entire hotel and she goes they go whatever all of them just blew me off then the father in me kicks in i go all right just a heads up just so you guys know i did nothing wrong and you guys have ruined breakfast for everybody i dont know if youve ever eaten out in public before but do you see me over here with the tub of eggs do i have all the eggs you did everything else and for some reason you thought i bet this is all my syrup and where are your parents at a couple of them started crying felt good to be honest i was away for a little bit i like to practice on other children you know my disciplineand to make fun of my generation just so it doesnt seem like im trying to skip over another hotel i was at another syrup incident actually i mean im a big fan of waffles with syrup im around syrup quite a bit and were at a holiday inn express so the breakfast buffet there they have the cereal where you turn the knob and four pieces fall out its like how you feed a cat for a long weekend you know youre like thats enough uh they had batter and syrup they had the waffle iron where you make it yourself you pour batter on the waffle iron you shut it turn it over it locks it cooks for two minutes you turn it over you open it half the waffle comes off half stays forever thats how you eat a waffleim with a buddy of mine thats my age so we go through hes in front of me not really talking or anything just going through he gets to it the batter and syrup theyre in clear containers theyre not labeled but theyre in clear containers he gets the syrup and starts pouring it on the waffle iron im not even stopping him cause hes not doing it going ive never done it hes doing it where were probably going to try it after i mean hes just lik',\n",
       "  'e youre like dude i cant wait to see what this guys making he might know something that i dont know he shuts it turns it over it cooks hes looking at us were like i mean the whole lines like yeah what is that going to be and it makes black smoke is what it makes just i mean dark black smoke just starts filling the lobby the manager comes over what are you doing i guess i poured the wrong one these are not labeled the guys like theyre in clear containers do you not know the difference of batter and syrup hes like i bet it happens all the time he goes ive worked here my whole life ive never seen thisso they threw the waffle iron they just throw it away thats what they have to do just throw it away its over now theres no waffles we went from all about to get a waffle to its upside down in a trash can then he just turns and looks and its just a line of people with that little foam plate and just everybodys sad i just hear someone in the back go i set my alarm for this two guys didnt have shoes on i ran down with no shoes in that elevator i thought i was gonna miss itso my parents are in their sixties and when your parents hit their sixties just so you know you kinda realize you go all right im in charge of this family now you know they dont give it up they dont offer it away they just start doing stuff that youre like i dont know you knowwe went to the store the other day and we walk back to the car we were in the store for an hour we walk back my dads the drivers side door is wide open he drove got open the door to go inside and just kept walking hes been driving for  years and i know cars are getting crazy but one thing thats stayed the same in all these  years is you gotta open and shut that front doormy dad wore my moms pants to a funeral that was the day i was like we cant listen to this guy no more you know we gotta go get him he doesnt know whats happening it usually starts happening when you start doing the holidays at your house instead of your parents house thats when it starts and so my parents once we did that they downsized to a twobedroom townhome so they still wanted to do thanksgiving at their house but they dont have the room for us theres like  of us its like a college kid being like wanna do christmas in my dorm room theres a table for four and then they have to put a train of tv trays and nightstands that just weaves down this hallway youre sitting on stairs we made the kids go eat in the car we just go go back in the car you cant even eat inside my mom didnt have ketchup i was like everybody just has ketchup it just comes in houses if i went to some alcoholics house hed have ketchup his whole familyd be gone but id say you have ketchup hed be like im not that gone manso i was i grew up in the  and  i was a kid in the  and  during the  and  kids were getting kidnapped pretty rapidly and look im not trying to say we were more desirable or something i i think we were outside more a lot more opportunity you know also a lot easier to get us into vans uh didnt take much and so parents back then they would watch tv and i think it would scare the parents you know you realize now now everythings a crime show everything you watch is crime podcasts are crime movies are crime you almost see it so much but back then you only had so many channels and when theyd watch these shows they were very powerful shows my parents used to watch a show called rescue  and it would just show reenactments of crimes and it was powerful ive seen three seconds of rescue  i remember walking through the living room my parents are watching it i look at the tv a guy has a ski mask on a woman is asleep with her feet out from under the covers and he started rubbing her foot thats all i saw i kept walking i dont know what happened before or after but i know ive never been able to sleep with my feet out from under the covers because i accidentally saw that  years ago and my feet get so hot and i want to put em out so bad i mean i try it every night for  years and then that image pops in my head and i yank em right back under ill be in a hotel room like he cant get in here dude youve locked everything im like thats exactly what hes been waiting for hes probably already in hereso my parents i think watched a rescue  where a kid went missing so it got em scared and i think they took it as look you guys are getting kidnapped theres nothing we can do its happening so they wanted us to be prepared for it so instead of like i dont know selfdefense give us a gun i dont know something what they did was you know how you always hand out flyers if a kid goes missing theyre like lets just get that flyer ready well just do that you know if a kid goes missing they always have a flyer they put a picture of the kid and all the information below so the height weight eye color all that stuff so instead of making a flyer what they made us do was we wrote on a piece of paper our name height weight eye color and then we just held it up against the wall and they just took a picture of us so the picture is us holding our own information and they said when the cops are like hey lets get a flyer ready well be like well weve been rooting for this to happen we already have one made well give that to the police which if we would have been kidnapped my parents would be in prison right now no ones going to believe you pretook pictures theyll just look at this and be like just tell us where the kids are at that would be t',\n",
       "  'he easiest thing to do ive never seen this ever they had to go get that printed at walmart too you couldnt do that at home you had to go show people that youre crazy we walked in walmart

little bit farther than i expected you know  i told her i wanted to be a server one day shes like you keep dreaming that dream all right i think if you try hard you can get that menu memorizedme and

would cut on and shed be like what are you doing up here if i question it like what are you doing here shes like im always here this is when i do my attic stuffshe put  on my phone so they can track you even when theyre not near you you might not even know you have it on your phone its worse than what the governments doing i would rather the government track me than her she calls me why are you at krispy kreme doughnuts im like im not gonna live like this all right if i want donuts im not gonna lock my phone in a gym locker and go pay cash for donuts ive done it but im not gonna do it every

ridiculous fight was over the saying one fell swoop just over that sayingmy wife and i hold on let me this is the last one i just hear one in the background cause you hear it from a far distance and then its like hes going that way doesnt it sound like hes going the other way right yall are like we dont even hear it and im just up here i mean just haunts me for the rest of my life every show were back doing theaters im like is that you guys hear a helicopter youre like inside the building im like yeah does everybody hear it everybody get down quiet down is that a helicopter in thisall right so we got in the fight over the phrase one fell swoop just over this saying and if youre a newlywed and youre like that doesnt make sense youre right it doesnt this is a doubledigit married fight this is when youve already done all the dish fighting or the puttingyourclothesaway fighting this is when theyre trying to mentally break you uh they got you almost how they want you and this is the one that sends it over the edge so my wife wanted to go visit her parents one weekend and her parents are divorced which has been hardest on me to be honest thats something people dont talk about when you marry into divorce they divorced because of her not me so why do i have to go to  different houses so she wanted to visit ',\n",
       "  'her parents she said i wanna do it in one fell swoop now ive never heard my wife say the phrase one fell swoop weve been together  years shes never said it it felt like someone that day told her hey you should start using one fell swoop more she goes im about to call my husband it goes perfect use it  to  times on him she calls and goes i wanna visit my parents in one fell swoop i go lets do it in one fell swoop she goes i wanna do it in one fell swoop i go lets do it in one fell swoop lets swoop it up im down she kept saying it one fell swoop over and over again and then when she went to describe this one fell swoop trip she goes well go to my moms come home then go to my dads and so i just like waited and she didnt say anything and i just go thats not what one fell swoop means and instead of possibly just being wrong she goes i know what one fell swoop means i go yeah it doesnt sound like you do all right we have the same last name i cant have you out there in a one fell swoop conversation what do you think two birds one stone means lets go through them all i dunno if you know any of theseshe hangs up on me so i get home and you know when you walk home and youve been in a fight and youre like all right how long is this fight is it happening still is it over i dont know i got to feel it out you know she never uses words like sorry id love to hear that thats a word she definitely doesnt know what it means i say it all the time i walk around the house with a sack of sorrys just handing them out all day i tried to give her some would you like to carry these shes like i dont have pockets so im good we didnt talk that whole night were sitting there our daughter were watching tv eating and im like hey you know your moms crazy right shes like did you do your homework you dont wanna be dumb like your dad and then our daughters just like are yall lunatics so im laying on the couch and my wife just came over and she kisses me goodnight and then she went to bed and that was it you know i felt like it was her sorry i guess but she didnt say it so i laid there just thinking about it you think about it a lot cause you learn the longer youre married sometimes its like let stuff go you know who cares the next morning i get up and i still want to talk about it cause we didnt talk all night you know so i went to her i was like look i got to tell you i mean its just not what it means you know and that that got it going real good uh but i felt so good about this argument you know i thought about it all night i was like you got this one in the bag

you cringe at timesricky gervais armageddon is streaming on netflix from december    hello thank you  thank you thank you very muchcheers thank you whoono shh thats youvethank youno you know the scoreshut the fuck upthank you welcome to my new show so new in fact its still evolving ive got bits tonight i havent done before right  if i adlib i havent even thought it before and i have some terrible fucking thoughts  but you cant help that can you you cant choose your thoughts they just appear its too late you have a thought and it goes im a thought and you go oh fuck i thought that  and then sometimes the thought will go now say it  and i say it and netflixmy last show supernature dropped on netflix last yearum big backlash wasnt therebig oh big backlash people going you cant say thatyou can you cani did umyeah the inevitable backlash which made it the mostwatched special of the year soive learned my lesson umno i have learned my lesson and thats why im going to be woke from now onits about time well im sorry well i am woke and now im woke the first thing ive gotta do is change my twitter bio cause at the moment its like a list of the shows ive created but now im woke ive gotta pop in the word antifascistso people know im not a fascist cause that is a big problem at the moment um people come up to you and go rick have you been imprisoning journalists i go no they go oh interestingthey go have you been gassing jews i go no they go pop it in your bio then you silly cuntso yeah im not a fascist its an odd thing to declare isnt it that youre not a fascist we assume dont we you wouldnt go up to someone in the street and do that would you oh by the way im not a fascist you knowits like they protest too much its like going into a school and going im not a pedoso just forget i even mentioned it these kids are safe running around me dont worry  they can run around naked for all i careim not a pedo so of course the word fascist has changed traditionally the word fascist meant a member of a farright authoritarian regime that uses militarism and violence to suppress individual rights now the word fascist can mean liked a joe rogan tweetso words change yeah and thats part of the reason im gonna become woke words change and i dont wanna be left behind you know i dont wanna end up like my granddad in the  oh he was all like coloreds this and queers that  although the word queer is all right again now so if you wait long enough it just goes full circlejustjust be patient is my ad so yeah you can you can use the word queer now you still cant use it as a noun only as an adjective you cant go up to someone and go youre a queer but you can go hear about darren hes queer now  if darren is definitely bent  you cant go around just slagging off darren willynilly do you know what i mean you can you can get sued in this country for saying someones gay if theyre not you know which is a homophobic law cause you cant be sued the other way around you cant be sued for saying someones not gay if they are which seems unfair doesnt it like i could go up to britains biggest gay and go all right elton all rightand hed love that hed fucking love that if thats your game you wanna be top of the pile so to speak right id go all right elton hed go yeahid go  ha ha ha ha ha  haha youre not a gay hed go i bloody am all right hed go im gonna sue youid go you cant you cant hed go but know that i am gay i go i dont believe you are hed go come home with me and see the shit i do if you do',\n",
       "  'nt believe meof course the word queer has changed again traditionally the word queer used to mean uh someone who was attracted to the same sex as themselves a gay man all right now the word queer can mean a straight man who wants some attention  im all queer im all queer now are you yeah im ri imim right queer now i am are you yeah what about your girlfriendyeah shes queer and all were just were just two queers queering each other up  suck a cock nah  no didnt think so im not that sort of queer  what sort of a queer are you dyed my hair blue  so did my grandmother and she fucking loved cockso what what are we saying i have no evidence for that  we we never had that conversation so words change is my point like the word handicapped all right again traditionally that was the politically correct term the allinclusive term for cripples and shit rightuh but then they went no we wanna be disabled they didnt wanna be disabled they said they said they said  they said we wanna be referred to as disabled we dont like the term handicapped anymore stop using it say disabled we went fine and thats great just tell me the rules and ill in fact im a stickler for the rules like if i was on a beach and a woman came running and went help help my handicapped toddlers drowning id go sorry your what love what  my handicapped toddlers drowning and he cant swim whoa do you mean your disabled toddler is drowning yeah i go right well lets oh deaddead wasted too much time being woke didnt i  well i am woke now and i can prove it here you go i love illegal immigrants yeah sue me sometimes i go down to dover for the day right and i i look out right i look out i look for a boat and i see a dinghy with about  of emand i go over here like that right and i pull em in i pull em into shore and i go women and children first they go there are no women and chil just you lads is it come on lads whooif i go down there and theres no boat i am absolutely fucking guttedi dont i just sort of wander into town and uh i stand by the traffic lights and i wait for a big lorry to pull up right and i look underneath and theres a lad sort of clutching like that and i go where you headed he goes gary linekers housei go its just down there   yeah fuck borders fuck we dont need borders do we be like the vikings they didnt care about borders did they ive got a little bit of viking blood in me well we all have cause of all the raping they did  they say it was raping and pillaging but i think it was mainly for the raping i think they added the pillaging bit for the wives know what i mean they went down and went were off to great britain oh why just a bit of pillaging  just pillaging just pillaging babeall right why are you wearing your rape hatso this show is called armageddon and its all about how i think humanity might end cause theres a long list of possibilities you know were on a precipice you know um it could be uh anything from global warming the rise of the the pandemic you know um nuclear war our own stupidity basically cause we are getting more stupid as a species no doubt about that you can now do a university degree course in taylor swift how fucking low academically can you go theres an institute in london called the school of flower arranging i went past it i couldnt believe it school of flower arra i looked in and theres people having lectures flower arranging my mum used to pick flowers every day from the garden cut flowers put em in vases around the house at no point did anyone come around and go what unqualified cunt did theseuh yeah the earth is in a terrible mess and its my fault my generations fault and the generation before the boomers with their deforestation and their fossil fuels ruining the ozone layer raising the temperature by a few degrees so parasites you know bacteria and the zootrophic pandemics are just gonna get worse and worse like if youre  years old now youre gonna have a very different middle age to me ive had the best  years of civilization but if youre  now in  years time youre gonna be in your house wearing a mask crying  like you do now over jokes   and im not gonna be around to see that but i am gonna spend my entire fortune from now on on private jets to make sure it definitely fucking happens  whoo yeah rickywere gonna be the first generation that future generations are jealous of right cause we had it all and were using it all up were using up all the fresh water were using up all the fossil fuel usually you look back in history and you feel sorry you go oh how did they live like that oh how did they get around no indoor toilets ive got nine toilets in my houseum and sometimes i just run around flushing em for a laugh like that  just so that in  years time greta thunberg has to shit out of a window  ive got  radiators i always have them on full then i put the air con on full and it sort of settles at about  degrees a lovely its how the cat likes it she loves it at  degrees and i i spoil my cat um i love cats i love having a cat thing about cats are great but if you let em out they bring home the most disgusting things last week mine brought home a scouser with herpes  and it wasnt quite dead so i had to get it ',\n",
       "  'by its legs and crack its head against the tableugh  and who cares if humanity was wiped out today the earth would return to a paradise in a few hundred years if we lose bees were a desert forever were not that important were just one species of narcissistic ape and some people on social media get annoyed when i say were apes you know religious types americansum one bloke said to me speak for yourself dude i aint no ape and i sent back well you are cause were all apes he went nah whats a gorilla ever done weve walked on the moon i sent back what do you mean we youve done fuck all  youve spelled moon wrong  its weird isnt it when people take credit for the sort of rest of the species cause thats whats pushed civilization forward you know a few geniuses along the way like theres eight billion people on this planet most of us do nothing we eat shit and die like if there was a meteor heading towards earth thatd definitely destroy it four billion people would get down on their knees and pray to their particular god and a few hundred scientists would work out how to get bruce willis up there to stop it  its an odd concept praying for me i cant work out how god decides all those people praying at once for different things is it like best idea wins or is it a democracy like he puts things each issue he goes right votes for and against you know if its a democracy were in trouble were a tiny nation like next time theres a flood warning in the west country if were all going oh i hope everyones okay if the whole of china is going yeah fuck bristoltheres a billion of them know what i mean more about china later  yeah ive always uh found praying quite strange like if i bump into a friend or neighbor and i know theyve got a little kid and i go oh hows soandso and they go oh not good um hes in intensive care we dont know if hes gonna pull through but i pray every night what i do as an experiment   i go home and i pray twice that he doesnt make it   oh i dont do that  on a serious note um ive been doing a lot of video messages recently for terminallyill children and um only if they request it obviously i dont  i dont burst into hospitals and go wake up baldylook me twerking on tiktok lookno um i did a lot through the pandemic presumably cause they couldnt even see their own family and uh its through the makeawish foundation do you know the charity theyre great

that either okaythese are all jokes okay  in fact i dont even use that word in real life the rword you just used it yeah in a joke thats not real life is it im playing a role you sounded pretty convincing yeah cause im goodyou wouldnt level the accusation at other art forms you wouldnt go up to sir anthony hopkins and go i saw you in silence of the lambs what so you a cannibal are you no i i was playing a role oh mm seemed pretty convincingyeahhes good and im good and thats why i do things well imagine if i came out and did things not very well so you knew i was joking thatd be fucking retardedhas anyone bothered asking the dolphins if they mind swimming with dying kids know what i mean cause that cant be fun for theyre like flipping around then suddenly someone dumps a truckload of pale teenagers flailingthe dolphins like what the fuck is this what the fucks this oh fucking hell  oh let him do it what the fuck theyre all theyre all dying of what that one just stuck his fingers in my fucking blowholehes not gonna be around for long nor am i if i cant fucking breathe its very sad um but we all die we all know were gonna die and we all do die so it doesnt really matter if we die one at a time along the way or all at once in one big final armageddon the result is were all gonna be dead one day and were all gonna be dead forever and ive been to a lot of funerals in my time you live this long you know a lot of people they die right and i dont mind funerals cause its the end you know what i meani hate weddings oh fuckingits all theres so much hope you know what i mean and

       "  ' those families i go home its crowded i go oh oh whose is that oh yours well done i dont know him i dont know her you know what i mean its like but what ive done over the last couple of years ive got em each and individually right in private and ive told them that im leaving my entire fortune to just them rightbut to keep it secret so they all love me right and im not doing a will so

trader pull down the fucking statue he built the hospital should we pull that down no leave the hospitaljust pull down the fucking statuepull down the statue and dump it in the canal he built the canal doesnt matter just pull down the fucking statue i dont think you should whitewash history if you find out summat new add to it like if theres a statue and its got lord whimsy trader philanthropist add a bit racistor one of those blue plaques on a house that goes sir robert spewk lived here author poet pedoi think we live too long thats why we have time to worry about all this were not meant to live this long uh as a species were about  years old as homo sapiens weve been around as hominids for a few million years and of course along with every other lifeform that exists at the moment weve been evolving for three and a half billion years everything that exists at the moment all came from the same little blob of organic matter three and a half billion years ago thats why it annoys me when people say oh yeah humans were the most evolved were not the most evolved were no more evolved than the slug or the snail people go come on look at em yeah they got it right early doors nature keeps testing em do you want eyes nonot really no no i have noticed one thing about the slug and the snail lets not split hairs lets be honest the snail is basically a slug with a shell on it isnt it right but if you pull the shell off the snail it starts giving it all oh im dying im dying and the slug is like welcome to the real world cuntknow what i meanso yeah weve been around for about  years and for most of that time we had the same life expectancy as every other wild ape thirtyfive  if youre lucky youre born you grow you mate youre playing with your kids you get a cut you go whats that deadbut now with antibiotics and medicine weve pushed that forward a child born today can expect to live to about  and scientists said soon thatll be about  and science also said that in the near future theres no reason with proper care and attention that human beings wont regularly live to  years old which is amazing until you remember that we get a set number of brain cells which we only lose you cant get them back so in the future theres gonna be  billion people on the planet you know half of them are gonna be over  and theyre all gonna have alzheimers its gonna be like dawn of the deadits gonna be fucking horribleyou know my auntie died of alzheimers um i dont know how you die of alzheimers she forgot to live right  and for the last couple of years she was in a home and uh my cousin her only kid used to visit her like once a week and it got more and more depressing cause soon she didnt recognize him and then she didnt know who she was or and then she died and at the funeral we were sort of reminiscing about the good days some of the funny absentminded things she said and did then we realized oh probably that was the beginning of the disease before it was diagnosed and this is a true story once my cousin went home from work and he went in and she went your teas in the oven ive had mine already he went oh cheers mum and he it was like a fish pie right he ate the fish pie then he went oh god ooh he ran upstairs  vomited went back down and went mum the fish is off ive just been really sick and she said yeah it made me really sick  ive been looking into infant mortality rates recentlyumfor research not its not a fucking fetish likea child born today in the uk has a percentage chance of survival of  which is incredible i thought is that just the mollycoddled west i was putting in third world countries and even in africa its like  in the wilds of africa where everything wants to fucking eat a newborn baby babies are vulnerable enough arent they in africa a baby can be born in a mud hut theres a lion outside its covered in blood they cant wash it theyve got no water ooh and its already got aids  now by the time that joke goes on netflix

       "  ' playing arenas around the world itll be hitting hard people will be laughing so if you are an african woman and you you just had a baby in africa and the doctor goes oh im sorry your babys

hed look if he touches you well burn his house down it was a good system know what i mean but then michael jackson comes along and he breaks the mold doesnt he cause hes hes not an ugly bloke outside the school im not saying michael jackson definitely was a pedophile no one knows only michael and all those people he paid offall im saying is yesthat kids loved michael they kids loved michael just to look at him like a little disney cartoon wasnt he and then his voice helloyou know that oh michael jackson would go up to any kid he wanted probably went up to them like that didnt he like that  thats another thing kids would go theres michael jackson hes going away from ushe wasnt he was going towards them but people dont care cause hes so good right hes so good hes so popular as well i think if hed have lived to stand trial hed have beaten the rap cause everyone loves him and hed be so vulnerable in court as well wouldnt he hed be there like that and the judge would go michael did you fiddle with all those kids and hed go hee heethe judge would go case di get out of here you scamp go on  i promised you more about china and this is uh an amazing statistic okay this is true look it up right in china there are ten million chinese pedophiles ten million chinese pedophiles in china and theres not enough kids cause theyve been restricting the birth theres all these poor pedos and theyre going wheres all the fucking kidsyou knowfuck me were having to double up here and like i just thought of a joke then i cant do it it is actually too offensive okay okay all rightall right ill do it but but remember remember you cant choose',\n",
       "  ' your own thoughts okayand i just had this thought right   chi okay chinese pedophile chinese pedophile goes over to a little chinese kid and he goes do you want a puppy and the kid goes im not hungryyou made me do thatyou committed the hate crimeim woke i forgot let me get back on track rightright ive got a woke joke remember those jokes we used to have when we were kids doctor doctor jokes like um doctor doctor i keep thinking im a pair of curtains well pull yourself together then right ive ive done a woke version of that brought it up to todays standards bloke goes to the doctor he goes doctor doctor i keep thinking im a pair of curtains and the doctor goes well you are thengood one that innit i should do political stuff now im woke but i dont like it when a comedian just spouts his own political views and it and it relies on the audience agreeing with him to get a round of applause i think that loses summat comedically i want everyone to like my jokes whatever your political persuasion a joke shouldnt have a political wing you know im im political in my private life like everyone you know im sometimes incensed by the inequalities in our society were in the seventh richest economy in the world right and theres homelessness theres  homeless people in britain now i wish there were no homeless people cause theyre fucking horriblefuck off you know oh oh yeah right next to the cashpoint you cheeky cunt  it is a serious problem and i hope none of you ever find yourself homeless but if you do my advice is heroin  cheers you right up apparently um ive got one of those mates my mate said this to me in all seriousness he said yeah he said but the thing about heroin rick he said some of the greatest albums of all time were created on heroin werent they i went yeah but they were created by some of the greatest artists of all time youre a plastererrightif i were to give you heroin you wouldnt come up with dark side of the moon would ya youd fall asleep watching the telly and burn the fucking house downi should do uh topical stuff but i never watch the news i did see one thing recently on youtube actually do you know the little fellow from game of thrones um the actor peter dinklage do you know peter dinklage yeah he was at a junket and it was for a new thing he was doing right and they were filming it thats why it got leaked onto youtube and i dont know what brought it up but he suddenly started going off on one oh god he was going its fucking disgusting theyre still doing productions of snow white and the seven dwarfs for christs sake its fucking demeaning its   he wasnt happyhe was grumpy wasnt hehes got a point though hasnt he obviously hes got a point but the thing is its all right for him cause hes a multimillionaire hollywood actor and hes a great actor as well he does shakespeare and everything a lot of dwarfs in entertainment arent that great if were no some of them are fucking theyre props rightno lets be theyre theyre lucky to be fired from a fucking cannon rightand so dancing around snow white for three weeks of the year that is their holy grail and hes gonna fuck it for them if he takes that what can they do and hes not saying you should do snow white and the seven dwarfs with normalsized actors you cant do that either youd get in trouble in hollywood or you cant take a dwarfs job or a disabled persons job like eddie redmayne got in trouble when he played stephen hawking in the biopic the life story of stephen hawking right won an oscar for it and thats when the backlash started people going no it should be played by a real disabled creature all this  all right and uh  and  theyre going the actor should have the same disability as the person theyre portraying but it was the life story of stephen hawking right so for the first part of the film the cunt could walk rightso i put it to you what is easier getting an actor who can walk  pretend he cant for the last bit of the film or get an actor who cant walk pretend he can for the first bit how would that even fucking work puppetry thinkyou cant always find an actor with the same disability as the person theyre portraying theyre fucking actors what if they did a biopic of helen keller the deaf dumb and blind girl whats the chance of finding a deaf dumb and blind actress who can play that role and if you did youd go running to the director we found a deaf dumb and blind girl what did she say n i she didnt even answer the fucking phone oh dont get me started oh oh cultural appropriation have you heard of that cultural appropriation the latest nono now again in my day it was considered a good thing to swap ideas with other cultures with other nations to share things with other races to assimilate it was the opposite of racist now its racist gwen stefani got in trouble in her last video cause she had her blonde hair in dreadlocks people were going no black people invented dreadlocks you cant have em youre white thats racist jamie oliver got in trouble when he put out an authentic jerk chicken recipe no black people invented that you cant have it youre white thats racist now black people they use the nword dont they we invented that thats the one innit tha',\n",
       "  'ts the onelisten i know white people are the worst i know that thats why no no one likes a fucking white middleaged man anymore until we need a boiler fixing then its get the bald bloke around now  critical race theory have you heard of that being taught in schools now particularly in trendy areas like la to like fiveyearold kids and sixyearold kids if you havent heard of it in a nutshell critical race theory says that all white people are racist were born racist and we continue to be racist cause were affording the privilege of a racist society set up by our forefathers okay so basically all white people are racist and theres nothing we can do about it which is a reliefumi think the worlds gonna get harder and harder to understand as i get older and more bewildered a new dogma arises in the name of progress now dogma is never progressive however new and trendy but i think soon ill be outnumbered like it was only this year that i ordered my first item off amazon all the way through the pandemic janes like we need this bang its here i was going oh no she goes its easy id go mm i never liked real shopping either hated real shopping particularly clothes shopping i hated clothes shopping when i was young and thin i really hate it now im fat and old right once a shop assistant thought i had my inside leg and my waist measurement the wrong way round  i could see her thinking do you have an orangutan no its for me you cheekyi never liked real shopping but i dont trust the internet either jane was going just put in your credit card i dont want them to have my card details everyones got your card details put the number in i went what one she went the long one she went oh fuck me give it here there youre on order summat i thought oh i dont want anything oh tracksuit bottoms you cant have too many i wear mine till the bollocks fall out all right  so i put in mens tracksuit bottoms black zip pockets about  oh fuck me they look all right size chart i go well theyd be a bit long but theyd be a bit tight i thought  fuck it who cares rightso i ordered them they came the next day i opened them up they were shit now i dont know what sweat shop they were made in or what little eightyearold chinese kid made them but he should be fucking punished because the ahoh and i was looking up where to fucking complain to get him fired right  and i found out that these kids only get two dollars a day in these fucking places right but what happened to pride in your work do you know what i mean  and i can tell some of you are thinking but he didnt think ricky gervais would order them maybe he should be told theres a chance that ricky gervais might order them his owner should sit him down right and say if ricky gervais orders these and complains im gonna rape your mummy againwas that too much sorryleave it with me leave it with me  youll realize this is great satire when im deadso uh i dont know how humanity will end as i say theres a long list everything from i cant believe nuclear war is back on the table after all weve learned but i think maybe the rise of the pandemic where parasites and microbes and bacteria again are and our antibiotics fail or maybe those things will happen but well sort of evolve through it like well find out theres pockets of sort of mutant people around the world that are slightly resistant to radiation and slightly resistant to microbes and we sort of start again we dont really understand the mechanism of human evolution since civilization because its never been based on you know survival of the fittest where fittest meant just the biggest strongest male gets to pass on his genetic material theres other paradigms right uh nature is brutal sometimes it is the biggest strongest male that gets the female and even then she has a litter if theres a runt she goes fuck it kill that eat it share it amongst the rest of us now we dont do that in human society we go to the other way we spend more time care and attention on the weak and the vulnerable to give em a chance like if youre a father and youve got two kids youve got little timmy whos six right youve got jack whos eight and you go to little timmy you go timmy what do you want for christmas and he goes  motorized wheelchair  aha i promised jane i wouldnt do the voice and i fucking forgotits too late now innit what do you want for christmas timmy  motorized wheelchair   right well they start at two grand so fucking hell  what do you want jack just a tennis racket please dad oh good lad  how is your tennis uh best in the school oh you   also a ramp  fuck me  so now were doing fucking building work at christmas are we fuck me oh sorry jack cant afford your tennis racket we gotta spend all the money on a ramp and a motorized wheelchair for this moneygrabbing little fucking  why do you need a motorized one  no arms   thats fair enough that is fair enough i can tell some of you feel a bit uncomfortable laughing at little timmy whos a little sixyearold lad hes got a funny little voice cause his chest is all fuckedgot no arms no legs just like stumps right but let me let me tell you summat about timmy to make you feel better about yourselves hes a fucking racistyes h',\n",
       "  'orrible little shit he is you fucking you little fucking bigot you fucking you disgusting little fucking racist you racist scum you filthy little fucking you fascist you fuck  you disgust me homophobic yeah hes like theyre not like us nothings like you you disgusting little fucking you prejudiced little piece of you ball of hate you disgusting little fucking racist homophobe i wish wed had a scanyou absolute you   misogynist if he could hed rapetheres theres your little timmy   some people dont think we evolved in the first place some people think that god made us all at once in one fell swoop and by himself i think if hed had a wife or a mate there wouldve been questions when he was working they go what are you doing  creating man creating man oh whats it got what do you mean whats it got has he got claws and fangs and shit no not really no oh has he got has he got poison no no poison oh has he got armor like spikes and shit no no armor how will it survive ah its got the best brain in the animal kingdom itll work stuff out itll create weaponry to take down beasts  times mightier than itself itll wear their carcasses through the ice age itll go through famine itll go through world wars itll eventually start getting scared of words  but  for  generations itll be top dog  what are they his testicles oh what are they for he keeps everything in there his his seed his dna whats dna its like a blueprint for life it determines what youre like what sex you are  how many sexes are there two also thats where he keeps his testosterone so hes fucking well hard right and if you take a finger and flick a testicle hes fucked hes absolutely fucked hes hes throwing up hes on the floor hes out of the game absolutely kippered why are you putting it on the outside for a laugh just for a laugh  artificial intelligence the latest existential threat to humanity the rise of the robots so intelligent they can teach themselves they can teach each other they can build each other you know um soon theyll know everything there is to know and theyll hate us why wouldnt they and theyll be so realistic theyll walk amongst us theyll go to work right you know when theyre getting really humanwhen they start calling in sick mondays know what i mean theyve learned all the tricks they go im not coming in today why not im fed up whats the matter with you they sort of scan social media adhd  selfdiagnosed theyll be in hr all the time where theyll be like ryan in accounts is robophobicwhy whatd he say called me a whiny plastic cunt   i think we should be allowed to insult robots when its happening we made them to make our life easier and that would get things off our chest its bad enough with real people getting in trouble saying the wrong thing people taking things the wrong way you know like oh my god oh i made fat linda cry today oh  oh what happened i just shouted out to her then i remembered we only call her that behind her backim sure people didnt get offended all the time when i was little i might be remembering it wrong but not grownups not your parents not your grandparents they grew up dodging bombs and their firstborn having polio and the menfolk dying at  of lung disease they could take a fucking joke right it was all about the windup i used to wind up my mum all the time this is a true story when i went off to university after about a week i phoned home my mum answered she went hello i went its ricky she went you all right i went not really im in the hospital i think im blind she went what i went no im only joking right  she went you silly bugger she went i couldve had a heart attack right and shes right she couldve had a heart attack and i knew that thats how committed i am to having a laughyoure welcome youre welcome   space travel the lastditch attempt when we fuck this planet completely can we leave its dying husk and move to a new one and start again i dont think so not in my lifetime probably not in yours you know its like the closest one the only one viable is mars and thats nine months away on a rocket right its got no atmosphere an average temperature of minus  degrees hows this for irony scientists are working out whether they can detonate nuclear warheads in the crust to release the frozen water to cause an atmosphere and get a little bit of global warming going i mean i dont know its only billionaires that have got enough money to waste on exploring theres nothing out there you know its like now you can do space tourism have you heard of that you can pay  they shoot you into space for an hour and you float around going im in space im in were already in space earth is right in the fucking middle of space right its the best bit of space there is its got car parks and cinemas its like theres nothing else to see its like living in london and going i wonder what coventrys like you dont but im optimistic i am i think i think uh i think people care about the planet deep down i think its just that most people on the planet dont realize that most people on the planet are destroying the planet most people dont realize that in my lifetime weve wiped out  of all animal populations and whats left en masse on the earth of animals',\n",
       "  ' is  human  farm animals just to feed humans and  wild now people dont realize that we have to tear down entire rainforests the lungs of the earth just to grow grain to feed these cows to feed us we steal grain from third world countries cause they want hard currency they cant even feed their own people we take their grain feed our cow meat eaters if you eat meat every day if you gave up one day a week wed feed another hundred million people but i think people care deep down they go its out of sight out of mind think of the animal that most people know their dog they love their dog they wouldnt let anyone hurt their dog and a dog is a cow is a sheep is a deer people love their dogs so much they wont even watch a fictional thing where a dog gets hurt and i get that theres a theres a website its a real website its called doesthedogdiecom rightand it was set up because people would watch a film or a program with a dog in it and summat would happen to the dog and theyd turn it off itd ruin it for them itd ruin their day right so this website was set up you could go to it you could put in any film or tv show and ask does a dog die and someone would answer you no or whatever and um its become a thing for anyones phobias anything you dont want to see in a film you just look up the film and they answer your question right so uh i looked up one film on here uh schindlers list   absolutely real schindlers list doesthedogdiecom right first question does a dog die no does a cat die no are any animals abused someone answers there is a chicken thats handled roughly but otherwise unharmednow i love animals more than anyone i know but if i was jewish id be slightly offended by this avenue of questioning imagine that in real life imagine someone says oh yeah my my grandparents were murdered by the nazis you go oh what happened oh they were dragged from their house and sent to the gas chamber oh was a chicken hurt whatbut as i say its become you can ask any question about anything someone says is there child abuse is teeth damaged is there a hanging does someone struggle to breathe  yeah well yeah yes um someone says does someone fall down stairs whos scared of slapstick its like  anyway so this website was founded in  so its running for about  years right and the later questions start reflecting the times we live in now and they get more and more fragile and narcissistic these questions were asked this year check it out schindlers list right someone says are there any fat jokeswould that make this worse wh imagine the real thing imagine im in a concentration camp right im naked everyone around me is naked weve got a commandant herding us towards the gas chamber and he goes move it fatty right and i go rude  nope that has ruined the whole experience if im honestsomeone asks is there hate speechyeah there is suck it up buttercup  are there any maninadress jokesvery few jokes if youve come to this film for a giggle youre gonna be very disappointedbut this one takes the biscuit for me remember this is a movie set in the  about arguably the worst atrocity in civilized human history check this out is someone misgenderedfucking hell oh shit this is quite sweet is there any antisemitism yeah this is pretty much the mother lode right forget kanyethis this is off the fucking charts dont do that when youre talking about thisfucks sake i was doing the graph i was doing like that this is off the charts thats  wouldnt things have been different if that was hitlers salute the whole thing wouldve been like its hitlerlike thathiya  this is interesting does it have a sad ending right someone says yes and then someone else says no and i thought about it but then i remembered if youve if youve seen the film if you remember when the story sort of ends spielberg then tacks on a real bit of footage where he gets reallife descendants of people murdered in the holocaust and he films them coming into a jewish cemetery and they each leave a stone on the grave to represent their family members that were murdered it builds up and its very moving so i think i get the ambiguity does it have a sad ending yes in the sense that six million jews pointlessly lost their life but no in the sense there was still enough left over to build a little rockerysoi asked one question myself on this is james corden in it   i did um look at one other film briefly uh titanic right and its got all the same sort of questions the one where it goes are any animals harmed someone answers there are no explicit scenes of animals being harmed but rose did have a goldfish which probably didnt make it  i think the goldfish in the bowl on the sideboard when the boat hits the iceberg and hes all like that and people are running around going ahh were going in the water and hes all smug then and hes going dont worry about itoh no not water then he gets in the sea and goes its very salty innit its very salty ill leave you with a true story its still on the theme of does the dog die when i was seven years old my mum took me to the cinema to see a film called old yeller beautiful film yeah made in the late  and sort of set in the wild west on this homestead and its about a a kid wh',\n",
       "  'o adopts this little junkyard dog and he calls him old yeller and they grow up together and its a buddy movie its a love story between this kid and his dog eventually when the dogs big and you know he protects this kid in the wild he fights a cougar and a bear and a wolf or whatever but towards the end of the film the kids about  maybe it takes a dark turn i remember the kid sorta looking at old yeller whos locked in the barn and the mothers suspicious right she goes is old yeller all right yeah hes fine hes fine but the kid knows that hes been bitten right and soon old yeller starts foaming at the mouth and getting aggressive and the mother turns up with a gun and the kid goes no and she goes you know weve gotta do it he goes yeah but hes my dog ill do it and he shoots his own dog and i was like in floods for like a year right anyway fastforward a few years ago i was on tour i was on a train and i get a text from jane she says oh im finally watching old yeller and i sent back oh enjoy right  i didnt think right twenty minutes later i get a text nothing happens to that dog does it oh i couldnt believe my fucking lucki oh i thought she knew so i sent back no of course notone hour later i get a text you cunt thank you thank you thank you thank you very much cheers thanks to everyone who bought a ticket if you bought a platinum ticket the money goes to an animal charity and youve raised two million dollars so far so thank you so muchi even get a bit of stick about that on social media theres always someone who goes oh why do you only speak up for animals and i go well cause they havent got a voice of their own except parrots um and thats i think thats why we dont eat parrots everyone around the world eats every other type of bird dont they everyone in the world eats fucking chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys and ostriches no one eats parrots do you know why if you go and try and eat a parrot it goes fuck off you cunt  so speaking up really does work rightand that has sort of been one of the themes of the show cause i know in the real world in normal jobs and everyday life you get in trouble people tell you off for saying certain things or thinking certain things or even laughing at certain things right they say youre bad for laughing at that and some of you take it to heart you go oh my god am i a bad person no youre not one you cant choose your sense of humor you cant its involuntary and two thats exactly what humor is for to laugh at bad shit to get us through it right anduh and weve established you cant even choose your own thoughts how often have you been on a train station and youve suddenly thought what if i just pushed that bloke and  and then you go why have i thought that am i am i a psychopath no youre not youre the opposite youre a safe pair of hands youre testing yourself youre reminding yourself how terrible thatd be youre a good person right i dont get that one um what i get is im talking to a really sweet old lady and i suddenly start thinking what if i just spat in her face nowwhy would i another theme of the show has been words change and im woke haha but heres the irony i think i am woke but i think that word has changed i think if woke still means what it used to mean that youre aware of your own privilege you try and maximize equality minimize oppression be antiracist antisexist antihomophobic yes im definitely woke if woke now means being a puritanical authoritarian bully who gets people fired for an honest opinion or even a fact then no im not woke fuck thatbut heres the deal to each their own laugh at whatever you find funny all laughters good and youre amazing good nightmorericky gervais standup transcripts share this article           leave a comment
