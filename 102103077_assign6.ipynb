He attributes much of his comedic beginnings to the nurturing environment provided by his parents, individuals who exuded both humor and creativity. Additionally, Carlin highlights the impact of his grandfather, who possessed a dual identity as a law enforcement officer and a writer, and his mother, who held a prominent role as an advertising executive in his life.\\nCarlin\\u2019s journey through the conventional educational system was marked by a sense of not quite fitting in. He attended an experimental school that boldly discarded the typical grading system and eschewed corporal punishment, an environment that proved instrumental in fostering and nurturing his creative tendencies.\\nThe interview also gets into Carlin\\u2019s personal struggles with addiction, offering a candid examination of his battles with substances. He credits his eventual triumph over addiction to the discovery of pursuits and connections that held greater significance in his life than the allure of drugs or alcohol. Throughout this challenging journey, Carlin acknowledges the indispensable support provided by his family and his dedicated fanbase, both of which played pivotal roles in helping him maintain his path to recovery.\\nGeorge Carlin\\u2019s unguarded and insightful responses offer a distinct vantage point on the intricacies of the world, as seen through the lens of his remarkable career.\\n* * *\\n40 YEARS OF COMEDY\\nHBO, 1997\\n\\u00a0\\nJON STEWART: When you were a kid growing up, you wanted to be Danny Kaye, and Bob Hope. So, look, how do you think this thing is working out so far? \\nGEORGE CARLIN: Well, I knew I wanted to stand up, and you know, I\\u2019d be silly and have people say, \\u2018Ain\\u2019t you cute? Ain\\u2019t you cute and clever?\\u2019 And that\\u2019s all it was, is a reward, a psychic reward, you know, when you\\u2019re a kid and you find out that you can get the attention of adults and approval and a little bit of respect, and you just hung for it, you keep going back for it. And I have, fortunately, genetic, you know, my little toolkit, my genetic toolkit, I was given, included a mother and father who were very funny people, could do accents and dialects and tell funny stories about what happened on the bus that morning and have a punch line. So, you don\\u2019t lick it off the rocks, they say in Ireland, so I think I thanked my grandmother\\u2019s milkman, actually, you never know where these things\\u2026\\nJON: It\\u2019s interesting, you know, as I watch now and through all the years of listening to your abs of things, your fascination with language, it\\u2019s so apparent\\u2013 watching your work, it\\u2019s almost like watching a musician, you know, the way you weave words and use language for emphasis and all that. Was that always a fascination for you, even as a kid? \\nGEORGE: Well, to go backward with the question, don\\u2019t forget what we do is oratory, it\\u2019s rhetoric, it\\u2019s not just comedy, it\\u2019s a form of rhetoric. And with rhetoric, you look and listen for rhythms, you look for ways to sing at the same time you\\u2019re talking. And to go, \\u2018doom, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo\\u2026,\\u2019 and it\\u2019s just natural. My grandfather, whom I never knew, was a policeman in New York at the turn of the century, and he was an uneducated man, self-educated. And he, in the course of his adult life, he wrote out the works of Shakespeare by hand because of the joy it gave him. \\nJON: That\\u2019s an obsessive young man. \\nGEORGE: Yeah, and most everything is genetic, and my mother cared a lot about language, my father was a champion public speaker of 1935, he won the mahogany gavel, over 800 other public speakers from the Dale Carnegie Public Speaking Institute, and he was great. I never knew him either. \\nJON: Were your parents put off by the direction that you went into when you started to go counterculture? Was it a difficult transition for them to watch? \\nGEORGE: Well, he was out of the picture, he was brilliant, and he was a top salesman in advertising, but he couldn\\u2019t metabolize ethanol efficiently, so he was given his hat. My mother was very brave, she left him when I was 2 months old, my brother was 5 years. She left down a fire escape, so he was gone. My mother was very kind of controlling, wanted to control my life, and was heartbroken when I began with the dirty language and the awful stuff he says about business. She was a bit, she was an advertising executive secretary, loved the business world, thought it was just the finest thing that ever happened. And so when I went in that direction at first, very opposed until one day\\u2013 we lived in the same street that I grew up. I thought I went to school, and I went to school on the same block I lived on, something like that, Corpus Christi school, and the nuns were great. It wasn\\u2019t a typical Catholic school, it was an experimental progressive school that didn\\u2019t have grades, didn\\u2019t have any sort of corporal punishment, it was just very, very wonderful school. And the nuns, she would see the nuns in the street, they would say, \\u2018Oh, we saw George on The Tonight Show,\\u2019 and she, being a bit of an actress, she would say, \\u2018Oh, it\\u2019s the awful language, Sister, the awful language.\\u2019 And one of them said to her, \\u2018No, no, you don\\u2019t understand, he\\u2019s using it for other purposes, he\\u2019s not just doing it for that, it\\u2019s kind of like part of what he does, don\\u2019t you understand? It\\u2019s this and that and so forth.\\u2019 So she said, \\u2018Oh, well, oh,\\u2019 and from that day on, she was okay with it because the church had approved it. That was that.\\nJON: People who deal in content that\\u2019s on the edges, you do oftentimes live a life that\\u2019s similarly on an edge, and a lot of those people go off the rails, and we lose them and their talent. And you\\u2019ve been able to not do that and being able to pull it back in. \\nGEORGE: And another luck stroke, you know, you gotta have luck in this world, part of its your genetic makeup, that\\u2019s luck, and then what you do with it is also partly genetic because hard work is genetic, the desire to do hard work, the willingness to work hard and be determined and not be said, not be turned aside, that\\u2019s all genetic too. It can be altered a little, reinforced, but some of the people who had so much edgy promise, they died young. I mean, Lenny Bruce, Sam Kinison, Andy Kaufman in his way, Freddie Prinze, John Belushi, Bill Hicks, and it\\u2019s just, I don\\u2019t know, of course, Bill had a natural disorder of his own, I think so did Andy, but it\\u2019s not always behavior, but \\u2014 so it\\u2019s not just genetic \\u2014 but it\\u2019s just that, I think there\\u2019s a degree of luck and intellect involved in giving up things that hurt you. That the drug and alcohol thing, it seems to me, comes down to this: drugs and these things are wonderful, they\\u2019re wonderful when you time first. They\\u2019re not around for all these millennia for no reason. First time, mostly pleasure, very little pain, maybe a hangover. And as you increase and keep using whatever it is, the pleasure part decreases, and the pain part, the price you pay, increases until the balance is completely the other way, and it\\u2019s almost all pain, and there\\u2019s hardly any pleasure. At that point, you would hope, that the intellect says, \\u2018Oh, oh, this doesn\\u2019t work anymore. I\\u2019m going to die, and I\\u2019ll dosomething.\\u2019 But you need people around you who can help you, and you need something to live for. You have to have something to look forward to\\u2013 to bring you out. You know, there are a lot of people don\\u2019t have a lot to live for, and they\\u2019re sort of stuck inside. \\nJON: Are there ever any fear that by giving up the drugs, you lose a bit of a genius by giving up the wild lifestyle? Sanity, being\\u2026\\nGEORGE: Well, that\\u2019s been a canard for a long time, that most of this creativity comes from being wacky, and I\\u2019m sure there\\u2019s a lot of truth in that as far as just being plain old wacky. Where the drugs are concerned, and alcohol, they do seem to open a window for you. They do seem to broaden the vistas at first. The thing you have to do is learn when, you know, it\\u2019s like all these great writers who became drinkers, you have to sort of let, like with pot, I\\u2019m not a big drug user anymore, but I have always a joint somewhere near me. I don\\u2019t kid, might be hidden. What I do, and I hardly touch it, maybe once a month, that would be frequent for me. But when I\\u2019m writing something, and I write perfectly straight, perfectly sober, I write a whole lot of stuff, six, seven, eight, nine pages. I really pour it out. The next day, one hit, it\\u2019s all I need now, one hit, and it\\u2019s punch-up time. Time to get this thing going. And you do find with that sort of judicious use, I find there\\u2019s some value in it. But most of the things we use don\\u2019t let you leave them alone. They don\\u2019t, pot does, thank goodness for that.\\nJON: Well, that\\u2019s excellent.\\nGEORGE: What?\\nJON: More than fair\\u2026 Why do you still care? Why do you still care enough to keep you at a point in your life where you could go back, you could do your month in Vegas, and Florence Henderson could open up, and you could go and hit a couple of balls and then some pinball. Why do you still care so much?\\nGEORGE: Well, I\\u2019m not comparing myself to any of these people, believe me, but you wouldn\\u2019t say to Picasso, \\u2018When are you gonna put those brushes down, get rid of the canvas, you\\u2019ve done it?\\u2019 Not you, I\\u2019m an entertainer first and foremost, but there\\u2019s art involved here, and an artist has an obligation to be on route, to be going somewhere. There\\u2019s a journey involved here, and you don\\u2019t know where it is, and that\\u2019s the fun. So you\\u2019re always gonna be seeking and looking and going and trying to challenge yourself. So without sitting around thinking of that a lot, it drives you in it, and it keeps you trying to be fresh, trying to be new, trying to call on yourself, calling yourself a little more, you know,\\nJON: And willing to put up with the grueling, promotional schedule and everything.\\nGEORGE: That\\u2019s the only way.\\n\\n\\n\\nJON: Picasso never had to do morning shows in Albuquerque, you know?\\nGEORGE: Right, and the only way I can do this is to go where the people are. They will not come to my house\\u2026 [\\u2026] bus rides and everything, they will not come. I have to go to Stevens Point, Wisconsin, or wherever it is, and the audiences are great. And they buy the tickets ahead of time, and they really wait for you to come there and see you in the theaters and concert halls it\\u2019s special because the audience, they do it beforehand, and you\\u2019re the whole evening. In Las Vegas, you\\u2019re an afterthought. You\\u2019re an also well, we could go gambling, we could go hooker in, we could get drunk, we could go to the convention, no, let\\u2019s go see this guy. And if they like you, they do, but they\\u2019re not committed fans, so it\\u2019s a different tone there, but it still works. You can still do some things there that you could feel good about, you know?\\nJON: Do you feel your place in comedy now? Do you feel that, you know, because I\\u2019ve been spending a lot of time with the festival and everybody that I would mention, you know, hey, I\\u2019m gonna do this, George Carlin should be in there, their faces light up, and to a person, \\u201creally Carlin?,\\u201d and can I meet him? Is he around? Do you feel that place is that?\\nGEORGE: Well, that is growing on me, I think, you know, longevity is a wonderful thing. Sometimes you get applause just for not being dead when you say, when you say, I\\u2019m going to be 60, they applaud that. \\u201cWonderful, not dead, 60.\\u201d Uh, so, but, but I\\u2019m, I\\u2019m getting a sense of it, you know, when you\\u2019re in planes three days a week. I go out every Friday, I come home every Monday. It\\u2019s three different cities, three different nights, airports, hotel lobbies. People have wonderful people. I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate people who have\\u2013 a group of people with a common purpose because pretty soon they have little hats and armbands and fight songs and a list of people they\\u2019re going to visit at 3:00 a.m. So I dislike and despise groups of people, but I love individuals. Every person you look at, you can see the universe in their eyes, if you\\u2019re really looking, and they\\u2019re great. And so, cumulatively, I have gotten the feeling that I\\u2019m in this big family, a family life I never had, by the way, this, so to say, extended family of people who feel like you\\u2019re their cousin, you know? I say, \\u2018Georgie\\u2019s 1961. I saw you,\\u2019 \\u2018Hey, remember, yeah, oh, and you know what you said?\\u2019 And I said, \\u2018Did I?\\u2019 Oh, yeah. So it\\u2019s, you\\u2019re not just great. And so, cumulatively, you say, \\u2018Well, I guess I\\u2019m in the family. I guess it\\u2019s okay.\\u2019\\nJON: Yeah. Do you think it doesn\\u2019t boil down after 10 HBO hours, after a multitude of best-selling albums, after Grammy nominations, after Emmy nominations, after Cable ACE Awards? Does it all boil down to what you would said originally that it\\u2019s about, \\u2018Hey, dig me\\u2026\\u2019\\nGEORGE: \\u2018Hey, look at me, ain\\u2019t I cute?\\u2019 That\\u2019s it, it just involves. It\\u2019s just a dopey call showing off. And if you can get them to not only stop and listen, but say, \\u2018Isn\\u2019t he cute? He\\u2019s real\\u2013 you\\u2019re cute.\\u2019 If you can get the approval\\u2013 you see, at school, we didn\\u2019t have grades, so we didn\\u2019t have A\\u2019s and B\\u2019s and C\\u2019s and D\\u2019s, the only A\\u2019s I got, and this is a little corny, I got their attention. I got their approval, their admiration, their approbation, and their applause. And those are the only A\\u2019s I wanted. And I got them. So\\u2026\\nJON: So you have mine, sir. I just want to say that, I can\\u2019t tell you enough what a pleasure this has been for me to spend some time with you and to be a part of this show, and thank you very much for all the wonderful\\u2013 to know you a little.\\nGEORGE: And you are gonna show us a lot, and I look forward to it.\\nJON: Thank you very much, sir.

He elaborated on the counterproductive nature of economic sanctions imposed by the West, positing that these measures have inadvertently spurred Russia towards reducing its economic dependency on the US dollar and diversifying its international trade relations. Putin expressed a readiness to engage in negotiations to resolve the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, attributing the lack of progress to the West\\u2019s continued military backing of Ukraine and a perceived reluctance towards diplomatic engagement.\\nFurthermore, Putin addressed the burgeoning domains of artificial intelligence and genetic research, underscoring the imperative for global regulatory frameworks to mitigate potential existential threats these technologies may pose. He expounded on the essence of Russian national identity, deeply intertwined with Orthodox Christianity and traditional values, drawing a contrast with what he perceives as the pragmatic and materialistic underpinnings of Western societies.\\nRegarding the detention of journalist Evan Gershkovich, Putin hinted at the possibility of a diplomatic resolution, suggesting that discussions around such issues are ongoing and could potentially culminate in Gershkovich\\u2019s release, contingent upon reciprocal actions from the West. Throughout the interview, Putin portrayed Russia as amenable to constructive dialogue, yet beleaguered by what he sees as the West\\u2019s adversarial policies and reluctance to acknowledge Russia\\u2019s security concerns and cultural ethos.\\n\\n* * *\\nTucker Carlson [Introducing the video]: The following is an interview with the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, shot on February 6, 2024, at about 7:00 p.m. in the building behind us, which is, of course, the Kremlin. The interview, as you will see if you watch it, is primarily about the war in progress, the war in Ukraine: how it started, what\\u2019s happening, and most presently, how it might end. One note before you watch: at the beginning of the interview, we asked the most obvious question, which is, \\u201cWhy did you do this? Did you feel a threat, an imminent physical threat, and that\\u2019s your justification?\\u201d The answer we got shocked us. Putin went on for a very long time, probably half an hour, about the history of Russia, going back to the 8th century. Honestly, we thought this was a filibustering technique and found it annoying, and interrupted him several times, and he responded; he was annoyed by the interruption. But we concluded, in the end, for what it\\u2019s worth, that it was not a filibustering technique. There was no time limit on the interview; we ended it after more than 2 hours. Instead, what you\\u2019re about to see seemed to us sincere, whether you agree with it or not. Vladimir Putin believes that Russia has a historic claim to parts of Western Ukraine. So, our opinion would be to view it in that light: as a sincere expression of what he thinks. And with that, here it is.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Mr. President, thank you.\\nOn February 24, 2022, you addressed your country in your nationwide address when the conflict in Ukraine started and you said that you were acting because you had come to the conclusion that the United States through NATO might initiate a quote, \\u201csurprise attack on our country\\u201d. And to American ears that sounds paranoid. Tell us why you believe the United States might strike Russia out of the blue. How did you conclude that?\\nVladimir Putin: It\\u2019s not that the United States was going to launch a surprise strike on Russia, I didn\\u2019t say so. Are we having a talk show or serious conversation?\\nTucker Carlson: That was a good quote. Thank you, it\\u2019s formidably serious!\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You were initially trained in\\u00a0history, as\\u00a0far as\\u00a0I\\u00a0know?\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Yes.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0So if you don\\u2019t mind I\\u00a0will take only 30 seconds or\\u00a0one minute of\\u00a0your time for\\u00a0giving you a\\u00a0little historical background.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Please.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Let\\u2019s look where our relationship with Ukraine started from. Where does Ukraine come from?\\nThe\\u00a0Russian state started to\\u00a0exist as\\u00a0a\\u00a0centralized state in\\u00a0862. This is considered to\\u00a0be the\\u00a0year of\\u00a0creation of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian state because this year the\\u00a0townspeople of\\u00a0Novgorod (a\\u00a0city in\\u00a0the\\u00a0North-West of\\u00a0the\\u00a0country) invited Rurik, a\\u00a0Varangian prince from Scandinavia, to\\u00a0reign. In\\u00a01862, Russia celebrated the\\u00a01000th\\u00a0anniversary of\\u00a0its statehood, and\\u00a0in\\u00a0Novgorod there is a\\u00a0memorial dedicated to\\u00a0the\\u00a01000th\\u00a0anniversary of\\u00a0the\\u00a0country.\\nIn\\u00a0882, Rurik\\u2019s successor Prince Oleg, who was, actually, playing the\\u00a0role of\\u00a0regent at\\u00a0Rurik\\u2019s young son because Rurik had died by\\u00a0that time, came to\\u00a0Kiev. He ousted two brothers who, apparently, had once been members of\\u00a0Rurik\\u2019s squad. So, Russia began to\\u00a0develop with two centers of\\u00a0power, Kiev and\\u00a0Novgorod.\\nThe\\u00a0next, very significant date in\\u00a0the\\u00a0history of\\u00a0Russia, was 988. This was the\\u00a0Baptism of\\u00a0Russia, when Prince Vladimir, the\\u00a0great-grandson of\\u00a0Rurik, baptized Russia and\\u00a0adopted Orthodoxy, or\\u00a0Eastern Christianity. From this time the\\u00a0centralized Russian state began to\\u00a0strengthen. Why? Because of\\u00a0a\\u00a0single territory, integrated economic ties, one and\\u00a0the\\u00a0same language and, after the\\u00a0Baptism of\\u00a0Russia, the\\u00a0same faith and\\u00a0rule of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Prince. The\\u00a0centralized Russian state began to\\u00a0take shape.\\nBack in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Middle Ages, Prince Yaroslav the\\u00a0Wise introduced the\\u00a0order of\\u00a0succession to\\u00a0the\\u00a0throne, but after he passed away, it became complicated for\\u00a0various reasons. The\\u00a0throne was passed not directly from father to\\u00a0eldest son, but from the\\u00a0prince who had passed away to\\u00a0his brother, then to\\u00a0his sons in\\u00a0different lines. All this led to\\u00a0the\\u00a0fragmentation and\\u00a0the\\u00a0end of\\u00a0Rus as\\u00a0a\\u00a0single state. There was nothing special about it, the\\u00a0same was happening then in\\u00a0Europe. But the\\u00a0fragmented Russian state became an\\u00a0easy prey to\\u00a0the\\u00a0empire created earlier by\\u00a0Genghis Khan. His successors, namely, Batu Khan, came to\\u00a0Rus, plundered and\\u00a0ruined nearly all the\\u00a0cities. The\\u00a0southern part, including Kiev, by\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, and\\u00a0some other cities, simply lost independence, while northern cities preserved some of\\u00a0their sovereignty. They had to\\u00a0pay tribute to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Horde, but they managed to\\u00a0preserve some part of\\u00a0their sovereignty. And\\u00a0then a\\u00a0unified Russian state began to\\u00a0take shape with its centre in\\u00a0Moscow.\\nThe\\u00a0southern part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian lands, including Kiev, began to\\u00a0gradually gravitate towards another \\u201dmagnet\\u201c\\u00a0\\u2013 the\\u00a0centre that was emerging in\\u00a0Europe. This was the\\u00a0Grand Duchy of\\u00a0Lithuania. It was even called the\\u00a0Lithuanian-Russian Duchy, because Russians were a\\u00a0significant part of\\u00a0its population. They spoke the\\u00a0Old Russian language and\\u00a0were Orthodox. But then there was a\\u00a0unification, the\\u00a0union of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Grand Duchy of\\u00a0Lithuania and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Kingdom of\\u00a0Poland. A\\u00a0few years later, another union was signed, but this time already in\\u00a0the\\u00a0religious sphere. Some of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Orthodox priests became subordinate to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Pope. Thus, these lands became part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Polish-Lithuanian state.\\nDuring decades, the\\u00a0Poles were engaged in\\u00a0the\\u00a0\\u201dPolonization\\u201c of\\u00a0this part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0population: they introduced their language there, tried to\\u00a0entrench the\\u00a0idea that this population was not exactly Russians, that because they lived on\\u00a0the\\u00a0fringe (u kraya) they were \\u201cUkrainians\\u201d. Originally, the\\u00a0word \\u2018Ukrainian\\u2019 meant that a\\u00a0person was living on\\u00a0the\\u00a0outskirts of\\u00a0the\\u00a0state, near the\\u00a0fringe, or\\u00a0was engaged in\\u00a0border service. It didn\\u2019t mean any particular ethnic group.\\nSo, the Poles were trying in every possible way to polonize this part of the Russian lands and actually treated it rather harshly, not to say cruelly. All that led to the fact that this part of the Russian lands began to struggle for their rights. They wrote letters to Warsaw demanding that their rights be observed and that people be commissioned here, including to Kiev\\u2026 1\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0I\\u00a0beg your pardon, can you tell us what period\\u2026 I\\u00a0am losing track of\\u00a0where in\\u00a0history we are?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0It was in\\u00a0the\\u00a013th\\u00a0century.\\nNow I\\u00a0will tell what happened later and\\u00a0give the\\u00a0dates so that there is no confusion. And\\u00a0in\\u00a01654, even a\\u00a0bit earlier, the\\u00a0people who were in\\u00a0control of\\u00a0the\\u00a0authority over that part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian lands, addressed Warsaw, I\\u00a0repeat, demanding their rights be observed that they send to\\u00a0them rulers of\\u00a0Russian origin and\\u00a0Orthodox faith. When Warsaw did not answer them and\\u00a0in\\u00a0fact rejected their demands, they turned to\\u00a0Moscow so that Moscow took them away.\\nSo that you don\\u2019t think that I\\u00a0am inventing things\\u2026 I\\u2019ll give you these documents\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0It doesn\\u2019t sound like you are inventing it, but I\\u00a0am not sure why it\\u2019s relevant to\\u00a0what\\u2019s happened two years ago.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0But still, these are documents from the\\u00a0archives, copies. Here are letters from Bogdan Khmelnitsky, the\\u00a0man who then controlled the\\u00a0power in\\u00a0this part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian lands that is now called Ukraine. He wrote to\\u00a0Warsaw demanding that their rights be upheld, and\\u00a0after being refused, he began to\\u00a0write letters to\\u00a0Moscow asking to\\u00a0take them under the\\u00a0strong hand of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Moscow Tsar. There are copies of\\u00a0these documents. I\\u00a0will leave them for\\u00a0your good memory. There is a\\u00a0translation into Russian, you can translate it into English later.\\nRussia would not agree to\\u00a0admit them straight away, assuming this would trigger a\\u00a0war with Poland. Nevertheless, in\\u00a01654, the\\u00a0Zemsky Sobor, which was a\\u00a0representative body of\\u00a0power of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Old Russian state, made the\\u00a0decision: those\\u00a0Old Russian lands became part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Tsardom of\\u00a0Muscovy.\\nAs expected, the war with Poland began. It lasted 13 years, and then a truce was concluded. In all, after that act of 1654, 32 years later, I think, a peace treaty with Poland was concluded, \\u201cthe eternal peace,\\u201d as it said. And those lands, the whole left bank of the Dnieper, including Kiev, reverted to Russia, while the entire right bank of the Dnieper remained in possession of Poland.2\\nUnder the rule of Catherine the Great, Russia reclaimed all of its historical lands, including in the south and west. This all lasted until the Revolution.3 Before World War I, Austrian General Staff relied on the ideas of Ukrainianization and started actively promoting the ideas of Ukraine and the Ukrainianization. Their motive was obvious. Just before World War I they wanted to weaken the potential enemy and secure themselves favourable conditions in the border area. So the idea which had emerged in Poland that people residing in that territory were allegedly not really Russians, but rather belonged to a special ethnic group, Ukrainians, started being propagated by the Austrian General Staff.\\nAs far back as the 19th century, theorists calling for Ukrainian independence appeared.4 All those, however, claimed that Ukraine should have a very good relationship with Russia. They insisted on that. After the 1917 Revolution, the Bolsheviks sought to restore the statehood, and the Civil War began, including the hostilities with Poland. In 1921, peace with Poland was proclaimed, and under that treaty, the right bank of the Dnieper River once again was given back to Poland.\\nIn\\u00a01939, after Poland cooperated with Hitler\\u00a0\\u2014 it did collaborate with Hitler, you know\\u00a0\\u2014Hitler offered Poland peace and\\u00a0a\\u00a0treaty of\\u00a0friendship and\\u00a0alliance (we have all the\\u00a0relevant documents in\\u00a0the\\u00a0archives), demanding in\\u00a0return that Poland give back to\\u00a0Germany the\\u00a0so-called Danzig Corridor, which connected the\\u00a0bulk of\\u00a0Germany with East Prussia and\\u00a0Konigsberg. After World War I\\u00a0this territory was transferred to\\u00a0Poland, and\\u00a0instead of\\u00a0Danzig, a\\u00a0city of\\u00a0Gdansk emerged. Hitler asked them to\\u00a0give it amicably, but they refused. Still they collaborated with Hitler and\\u00a0engaged together in\\u00a0the\\u00a0partitioning of\\u00a0Czechoslovakia.\\nTucker Carlson: May I\\u00a0ask\\u2026 You are making the\\u00a0case that Ukraine, certain parts of\\u00a0Ukraine, Eastern Ukraine, in\\u00a0fact, has been Russia for\\u00a0hundreds of\\u00a0years, why wouldn\\u2019t you just take it when you became President 24 years ago? Your have nuclear weapons, they don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s actually your land. Why did you wait so long?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u2019ll tell you. I\\u2019m coming to\\u00a0that. This briefing is coming to\\u00a0an\\u00a0end. It might be boring, but it explains many things.\\nTucker Carlson: It\\u2019s not boring.\\nVladimir Putin: Good. Good. I\\u00a0am so gratified that you appreciate that. Thank you.\\nSo before World War II, Poland collaborated with Hitler and although it did not yield to Hitler\\u2019s demands, it still participated in the partitioning of Czechoslovakia together with Hitler. As the Poles had not given the Danzig Corridor to Germany, and went too far, pushing Hitler to start World War II by attacking them. Why was it Poland against whom the war started on 1 September 1939? Poland turned out to be uncompromising, and Hitler had nothing to do but start implementing his plans with Poland.5\\nBy\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, the\\u00a0USSR\\u00a0\\u2014 I\\u00a0have read some archive documents\\u00a0\\u2014 behaved very honestly. It asked Poland\\u2019s permission to\\u00a0transit its troops through the\\u00a0Polish territory to\\u00a0help Czechoslovakia. But the\\u00a0then Polish foreign minister said that if the\\u00a0Soviet planes flew over Poland, they would be downed over the\\u00a0territory of\\u00a0Poland. But that doesn\\u2019t matter. What matters is that the\\u00a0war began, and\\u00a0Poland fell prey to\\u00a0the\\u00a0policies it had pursued against Czechoslovakia, as\\u00a0under the\\u00a0well-known Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, part of\\u00a0that territory, including western Ukraine, was to\\u00a0be given to\\u00a0Russia. Thus Russia, which was then named the\\u00a0USSR, regained its historical lands.\\nAfter the\\u00a0victory in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Great Patriotic War, as\\u00a0we call World War II, all those territories were ultimately enshrined as\\u00a0belonging to\\u00a0Russia, to\\u00a0the\\u00a0USSR. As\\u00a0for\\u00a0Poland, it received, apparently in\\u00a0compensation, the\\u00a0lands which had originally being German: the\\u00a0eastern parts of\\u00a0Germany (these are now western lands of\\u00a0Poland). Of\\u00a0course, Poland regained access to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Baltic sea, and\\u00a0Danzig, which was once again given its Polish name. So this was how this situation developed.\\nIn\\u00a01922, when the\\u00a0USSR was being established, the\\u00a0Bolsheviks started building the\\u00a0USSR and\\u00a0established the\\u00a0Soviet Ukraine, which had never existed before.\\nTucker Carlson: Right.\\nVladimir Putin: Stalin insisted that those republics be included in the USSR as autonomous entities. For some inexplicable reason, Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, insisted that they be entitled to withdraw from the USSR. And, again for some unknown reasons, he transferred to that newly established Soviet Republic of Ukraine some of the lands together with people living there, even though those lands had never been called Ukraine; and yet they were made part of that Soviet Republic of Ukraine. Those lands included the Black Sea region, which was received under Catherine the Great and which had no historical connection with Ukraine whatsoever.\\nEven if we go as\\u00a0far back as\\u00a01654, when these lands returned to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian Empire, that territory was the\\u00a0size of\\u00a0three to\\u00a0four regions of\\u00a0modern Ukraine, with no Black Sea region. That was completely out of\\u00a0the\\u00a0question.\\nTucker Carlson: In\\u00a01654?\\nVladimir Putin: Exactly.\\nTucker Carlson: You have, I\\u00a0see, encyclopedic knowledge of\\u00a0this region. But why didn\\u2019t you make this case for\\u00a0the\\u00a0first 22 years as\\u00a0president, that Ukraine wasn\\u2019t a\\u00a0real country?\\nVladimir Putin: The\\u00a0Soviet Ukraine was given a\\u00a0great deal of\\u00a0territory that had never belonged to\\u00a0it, including the\\u00a0Black Sea region. At\\u00a0some point, when Russia received them as\\u00a0an\\u00a0outcome of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russo-Turkish wars, they were called \\u201cNew Russia\\u201d or\\u00a0Novorossiya. But that does not matter. What matters is that Lenin, the\\u00a0founder of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet State, established Ukraine that way. For\\u00a0decades, the\\u00a0Ukrainian Soviet Republic developed as\\u00a0part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0USSR, and\\u00a0for\\u00a0unknown reasons again, the\\u00a0Bolsheviks were engaged in\\u00a0Ukrainianization. It was not merely because the\\u00a0Soviet leadership was composed to\\u00a0a\\u00a0great extent of\\u00a0those originating from Ukraine. Rather, it was explained by\\u00a0the\\u00a0general policy of\\u00a0indigenization pursued by\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union. Same things were done in\\u00a0other Soviet republics. This involved promoting national languages and\\u00a0national cultures, which is not bad in\\u00a0principle. That is how the\\u00a0Soviet Ukraine was created.\\nAfter World War II, Ukraine received, in addition to the lands that had belonged to Poland before the war, part of the lands that had previously belonged to Hungary and Romania (today known as Western Ukraine). So Romania and Hungary had some of their lands taken away and given to the Ukraine and they still remain part of Ukraine. So in this sense, we have every reason to affirm that Ukraine is an artificial state that was shaped at Stalin\\u2019s will.6\\nTucker Carlson: Do you believe Hungary has a\\u00a0right to\\u00a0take back its land from Ukraine? And\\u00a0that other nations have a\\u00a0right to\\u00a0go back to\\u00a0their 1654 borders?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0am not sure whether they should go back to\\u00a0the\\u00a01654 borders, but given Stalin\\u2019s time, so-called Stalin\\u2019s regime\\u00a0\\u2014 which as\\u00a0many claim saw numerous violations of\\u00a0human rights and\\u00a0violations of\\u00a0the\\u00a0rights of\\u00a0other states\\u00a0\\u2013 one may say that they could claim back those lands of\\u00a0theirs, while having no right to\\u00a0do that, it is at\\u00a0least understandable\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\nTucker Carlson: Have you told Viktor Orb\\u00e1n that he can have a\\u00a0part of\\u00a0Ukraine?\\nVladimir Putin: Never. I\\u00a0have never told him. Not a\\u00a0single time. We have not even had any conversation on\\u00a0that, but I\\u00a0actually know for\\u00a0sure that Hungarians who live there wanted to\\u00a0get back to\\u00a0their historical land.\\nMoreover, I\\u00a0would like to\\u00a0share a\\u00a0very interesting story with you, I\\u2019ll digress, it\\u2019s a\\u00a0personal one. Somewhere in\\u00a0the\\u00a0early 80\\u2019s, I\\u00a0went on\\u00a0a\\u00a0road trip on\\u00a0a\\u00a0car from then-Leningrad (now St. Petersburg) across the\\u00a0Soviet Union through Kiev, made a\\u00a0stop in\\u00a0Kiev, and\\u00a0then went to\\u00a0Western Ukraine. I\\u00a0went to\\u00a0the\\u00a0town of\\u00a0Beregovoye, and\\u00a0all the\\u00a0names of\\u00a0towns and\\u00a0villages there were in\\u00a0Russian and\\u00a0in\\u00a0a\\u00a0language I\\u00a0didn\\u2019t understand\\u00a0\\u2013 in\\u00a0Hungarian . In\\u00a0Russian and\\u00a0in\\u00a0Hungarian. Not in\\u00a0Ukrainian\\u00a0\\u2013 in\\u00a0Russian and\\u00a0in\\u00a0Hungarian.\\nI\\u00a0was driving through some kind of\\u00a0a\\u00a0village and\\u00a0there were men sitting next to\\u00a0the\\u00a0houses and\\u00a0they were wearing black three-piece suits and\\u00a0black cylinder hats. I\\u00a0asked, \\u201dAre they some kind of\\u00a0entertainers?\\u201c I\\u00a0was told, \\u201dNo, they\\u2019re not entertainers. They\\u2019re Hungarians. \\u2018I\\u00a0said, \\u2018What are they doing here?\\u2019\\u00a0\\u2014 \\u2018What do you mean? This is their land, they live here.\\u2019 This was during the\\u00a0Soviet time, in\\u00a0the\\u00a01980\\u2019s. They preserve the\\u00a0Hungarian language, Hungarian names, and\\u00a0all their national costumes. They are Hungarians and\\u00a0they feel themselves to\\u00a0be Hungarians. And\\u00a0of\\u00a0course, when now there is an\\u00a0infringement\\u2026.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0And\\u00a0there\\u2019s a\\u00a0lot of\\u00a0that though, I\\u00a0think. Many nations feel upset about\\u00a0\\u2014 there are Transylvanians as\\u00a0well as\\u00a0you, others, you know\\u00a0\\u2014 but many nations feel frustrated by\\u00a0their re-drawn borders after the\\u00a0wars of\\u00a0the\\u00a020th\\u00a0century, and\\u00a0wars going back a\\u00a0thousand years, the\\u00a0ones that you mention, but the\\u00a0fact is that you didn\\u2019t make this case in\\u00a0public until two years ago in\\u00a0February, and\\u00a0in\\u00a0the\\u00a0case that you made, which I\\u00a0read today, you explain a\\u00a0great length that you thought a\\u00a0physical threat from the\\u00a0West and\\u00a0NATO, including potentially a\\u00a0nuclear threat, and\\u00a0that\\u2019s what got you to\\u00a0move. Is that a\\u00a0fair characterization of\\u00a0what you said?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0I\\u00a0understand that my\\u00a0long speeches probably fall outside of\\u00a0the\\u00a0genre of\\u00a0an\\u00a0interview. That is why I\\u00a0asked you at\\u00a0the\\u00a0beginning: \\u201dAre we going to\\u00a0have a\\u00a0serious talk or\\u00a0a\\u00a0show?\\u201c You said\\u00a0\\u2014 a\\u00a0serious talk. So bear with me please.\\nWe are coming to\\u00a0the\\u00a0point where the\\u00a0Soviet Ukraine was established. Then, in\\u00a01991, the\\u00a0Soviet Union collapsed. And\\u00a0everything that Russia had generously bestowed on\\u00a0Ukraine was \\u201ddragged away\\u201c by\\u00a0the\\u00a0latter.\\nI\\u2019m coming to\\u00a0a\\u00a0very important point of\\u00a0today\\u2019s agenda. After all, the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union was effectively initiated by\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian leadership. I\\u00a0do not understand what the\\u00a0Russian leadership was guided by\\u00a0at\\u00a0the\\u00a0time, but I\\u00a0suspect there were several reasons to\\u00a0think everything would be fine.\\nFirst, I\\u00a0think that the\\u00a0then Russian leadership believed that the\\u00a0fundamentals of\\u00a0the\\u00a0relationship between Russia and\\u00a0Ukraine were: in\\u00a0fact, a\\u00a0common language\\u00a0\\u2014 more than 90 percent of\\u00a0the\\u00a0population there spoke Russian; family ties\\u00a0\\u2014 every third person there had some kind of\\u00a0family or\\u00a0friendship ties; common culture; common history; finally, common faith; co-existence within a\\u00a0single state for\\u00a0centuries; and\\u00a0deeply interconnected economies. All of\\u00a0these were so fundamental. All these elements together make our good relations inevitable.\\nThe\\u00a0second point is a\\u00a0very important one. I\\u00a0want you as\\u00a0an\\u00a0American citizen and\\u00a0your viewers to\\u00a0hear about this as\\u00a0well. The\\u00a0former Russian leadership assumed that the\\u00a0Soviet Union had ceased to\\u00a0exist and\\u00a0therefore there were no longer any ideological dividing lines. Russia even agreed, voluntarily and\\u00a0proactively, to\\u00a0the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union and\\u00a0believed that this would be understood by\\u00a0the\\u00a0so-called (now in\\u00a0scare quotes) \\u201dcivilized West\\u201c as\\u00a0an\\u00a0invitation for\\u00a0cooperation and\\u00a0associateship. That is what Russia was expecting both from the\\u00a0United States and\\u00a0the\\u00a0so-called collective West as\\u00a0a\\u00a0whole.\\nThere were smart people, including in\\u00a0Germany. Egon Bahr, a\\u00a0major politician of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Social Democratic Party, who insisted in\\u00a0his personal conversations with the\\u00a0Soviet leadership on\\u00a0the\\u00a0brink of\\u00a0the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union that a\\u00a0new security system should be established in\\u00a0Europe. Help should be given to\\u00a0unify Germany, but a\\u00a0new system should also be established to\\u00a0include the\\u00a0United States, Canada, Russia, and\\u00a0other Central European countries. But NATO needs not to\\u00a0expand. That\\u2019s what he said: if NATO expands, everything would be just the\\u00a0same as\\u00a0during the\\u00a0Cold War, only closer to\\u00a0Russia\\u2019s borders. That\\u2019s all. He was a\\u00a0wise old man, but no one listened to\\u00a0him. In\\u00a0fact, he got angry once (we have a\\u00a0record of\\u00a0this conversation in\\u00a0our archives): \\u201dIf, he said, you don\\u2019t listen to\\u00a0me, I\\u2019m never setting my\\u00a0foot in\\u00a0Moscow once again.\\u201c He was frustrated with the\\u00a0Soviet leadership. He was right, everything happened just as\\u00a0he had said.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Well, of\\u00a0course, it did come true, and\\u00a0you\\u2019ve mentioned it many times. I\\u00a0think, it\\u2019s a\\u00a0fair point. And\\u00a0many in\\u00a0America thought that relations between Russia and\\u00a0United States would be fine after the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union, at\\u00a0the\\u00a0core. But the\\u00a0opposite happened. But have never explained why you think that happened, except to\\u00a0say that the\\u00a0West fears a\\u00a0strong Russia. But we have a\\u00a0strong China that the\\u00a0West doesn\\u2019t seem to\\u00a0be very afraid of. What about Russia, what do you think convinced the\\u00a0policymakers to\\u00a0take it down?\\nVladimir Putin: The\\u00a0West is afraid of\\u00a0a\\u00a0strong China more than it fears a\\u00a0strong Russia because Russia has 150 million people, and\\u00a0China has a\\u00a01.5 billion population, and\\u00a0its economy is growing by\\u00a0leaps and\\u00a0bounds\\u00a0\\u2014 over five percent a\\u00a0year, it used to\\u00a0be even more. But that\\u2019s enough for\\u00a0China. As\\u00a0Bismark once put it, potentials are most important. China\\u2019s potential is enormous\\u00a0\\u2014 it is the\\u00a0biggest economy in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world today in\\u00a0terms of\\u00a0purchasing power parity and\\u00a0the\\u00a0size of\\u00a0the\\u00a0economy. It has already overtaken the\\u00a0United States, quite a\\u00a0long time ago, and\\u00a0it is growing at\\u00a0a\\u00a0rapid clip.\\nLet\\u2019s not talk about who is afraid of\\u00a0whom, let\\u2019s not reason in\\u00a0such terms. And\\u00a0let\\u2019s get into the\\u00a0fact that after 1991, when Russia expected that it would be welcomed into the\\u00a0brotherly family of\\u00a0\\u201dcivilized nations,\\u201c nothing like this happened. You tricked us (I\\u00a0don\\u2019t mean you personally when I\\u00a0say \\u201dyou\\u201c, of\\u00a0course, I\\u2019m talking about the\\u00a0United States), the\\u00a0promise was that NATO would not expand eastward, but it happened five times, there were five waves of\\u00a0expansion. We tolerated all that, we were trying to\\u00a0persuade them, we were saying: \\u201dPlease don\\u2019t, we are as\\u00a0bourgeois now as\\u00a0you are, we are a\\u00a0market economy, and\\u00a0there is no Communist Party power. Let\\u2019s negotiate.\\u201c Moreover, I\\u00a0have also said this publicly before (let\\u2019s look at\\u00a0Yeltsin\\u2019s times now), there was a\\u00a0moment when a\\u00a0certain rift started growing between us. Before that, Yeltsin came to\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, remember, he spoke in\\u00a0Congress and\\u00a0said the\\u00a0good words: \\u201dGod bless America\\u201c. Everything he said were signals\\u00a0\\u2014 let us in.\\nRemember the\\u00a0developments in\\u00a0Yugoslavia, before that Yeltsin was lavished with praise, as\\u00a0soon as\\u00a0the\\u00a0developments in\\u00a0Yugoslavia started, he raised his voice in\\u00a0support of\\u00a0Serbs, and\\u00a0we couldn\\u2019t but raise our voices for\\u00a0Serbs in\\u00a0their defense. I\\u00a0understand that there were complex processes underway there, I\\u00a0do. But Russia could not help raising its voice in\\u00a0support of\\u00a0Serbs, because Serbs are also a\\u00a0special and\\u00a0close to\\u00a0us nation, with Orthodox culture and\\u00a0so on. It\\u2019s a\\u00a0nation that has suffered so much for\\u00a0generations. Well, regardless, what is important is that Yeltsin expressed his support. What did the\\u00a0United States do? In\\u00a0violation of\\u00a0international law and\\u00a0the\\u00a0UN Charter it started bombing Belgrade.\\nIt was the\\u00a0United States that let the\\u00a0genie out of\\u00a0the\\u00a0bottle. Moreover, when Russia protested and\\u00a0expressed its resentment, what was said? The\\u00a0UN Charter and\\u00a0international law have become obsolete. Now everyone invokes international law, but at\\u00a0that time they started saying that everything was outdated, everything had to\\u00a0be changed.\\nIndeed, some things need to\\u00a0be changed as\\u00a0the\\u00a0balance of\\u00a0power has changed, it\\u2019s true, but not in\\u00a0this manner. Yeltsin was immediately dragged through the\\u00a0mud, accused of\\u00a0alcoholism, of\\u00a0understanding nothing, of\\u00a0knowing nothing. He understood everything, I\\u00a0assure you.\\nWell, I\\u00a0became President in\\u00a02000. I\\u00a0thought: okay, the\\u00a0Yugoslav issue is over, but we should try to\\u00a0restore relations. Let\\u2019s reopen the\\u00a0door that Russia had tried to\\u00a0go through. And\\u00a0moreover, I\\u2019ve said it publicly, I\\u00a0can reiterate. At\\u00a0a\\u00a0meeting here in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Kremlin with the\\u00a0outgoing President Bill Clinton, right here in\\u00a0the\\u00a0next room, I\\u00a0said to\\u00a0him, I\\u00a0asked him, \\u201d Bill, do you think if Russia asked to\\u00a0join NATO, do you think it would happen?\\u201c Suddenly he said: \\u201dYou know, it\\u2019s interesting, I\\u00a0think so.\\u201c But in\\u00a0the\\u00a0evening, when we had dinner, he said, \\u201dYou know, I\\u2019ve talked to\\u00a0my\\u00a0team, no-no, it\\u2019s not possible now.\\u201c You can ask him, I\\u00a0think he will watch our interview, he\\u2019ll confirm it. I\\u00a0wouldn\\u2019t have said anything like that if it hadn\\u2019t happened. Okay, well, it\\u2019s impossible now.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Were you sincere? Would you have joined NATO?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Look, I\\u00a0asked the\\u00a0question, \\u201dIs it possible or\\u00a0not?\\u201c And\\u00a0the\\u00a0answer I\\u00a0got was no. If I\\u00a0was insincere in\\u00a0my\\u00a0desire to\\u00a0find out what the\\u00a0leadership\\u2019s position was\\u2026\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0But if he would say yes, would you have joined NATO?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0If he had said yes, the\\u00a0process of\\u00a0rapprochement would have commenced, and\\u00a0eventually it might have happened if we had seen some sincere wish on\\u00a0the\\u00a0side of\\u00a0our partners. But it didn\\u2019t happen. Well, no means no, okay, fine.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Why do you think that is? Just to\\u00a0get to\\u00a0motive. I\\u00a0know, you\\u2019re clearly bitter about it. I\\u00a0understand. But why do you think the\\u00a0West rebuffed you then? Why the\\u00a0hostility? Why did the\\u00a0end of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Cold War not fix the\\u00a0relationship? What motivates this from your point of\\u00a0view?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You said I\\u00a0was bitter about the\\u00a0answer. No, it\\u2019s not bitterness, it\\u2019s just a\\u00a0statement of\\u00a0fact. We\\u2019re not the\\u00a0bride and\\u00a0groom, bitterness, resentment, it\\u2019s not about those kinds of\\u00a0matters in\\u00a0such circumstances. We just realised we weren\\u2019t welcome there, that\\u2019s all. Okay, fine. But let\\u2019s build relations in\\u00a0another manner, let\\u2019s look for\\u00a0common ground elsewhere. Why we received such a\\u00a0negative response, you should ask your leader. I\\u00a0can only guess why: too big a\\u00a0country, with its own opinion and\\u00a0so on. And\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States\\u00a0\\u2013 I\\u00a0have seen how issues are being resolved in\\u00a0NATO.\\nI\\u00a0will give you another example now, concerning Ukraine. The\\u00a0US leadership exerts pressure, and\\u00a0all NATO members obediently vote, even if they do not like something. Now, I\\u2019ll tell you what happened in\\u00a0this regard with Ukraine in\\u00a02008, although it\\u2019s being discussed, I\\u2019m not going to\\u00a0open a\\u00a0secret to\\u00a0you, say anything new. Nevertheless, after that, we tried to\\u00a0build relations in\\u00a0different ways. For\\u00a0example, the\\u00a0events in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Middle East, in\\u00a0Iraq, we were building relations with the\\u00a0United States in\\u00a0a\\u00a0very soft, prudent, cautious manner.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\u00a0repeatedly raised the\\u00a0issue that the\\u00a0United States should not support separatism or\\u00a0terrorism in\\u00a0the\\u00a0North Caucasus. But they continued to\\u00a0do it anyway. And\\u00a0political support, information support, financial support, even military support came from the\\u00a0United States and\\u00a0its satellites for\\u00a0terrorist groups in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Caucasus.\\nI\\u00a0once raised this issue with my\\u00a0colleague, also the\\u00a0President of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States. He says, \\u201dIt\\u2019s impossible! Do you have proof?\\u201c I\\u00a0said, \\u201dYes.\\u201c I\\u00a0was prepared for\\u00a0this conversation and\\u00a0I\\u00a0gave him that proof. He looked at\\u00a0it and, you know what he said? I\\u00a0apologise, but that\\u2019s what happened, I\\u2019ll quote. He says, \\u201dWell, I\\u2019m gonna kick their ass\\u201c. We waited and\\u00a0waited for\\u00a0some response\\u00a0\\u2013 there was no reply.\\nI\\u00a0said to\\u00a0the\\u00a0FSB Director: \\u201dWrite to\\u00a0the\\u00a0CIA. What is the\\u00a0result of\\u00a0the\\u00a0conversation with the\\u00a0President?\\u201c He wrote once, twice, and\\u00a0then we got a\\u00a0reply. We have the\\u00a0answer in\\u00a0the\\u00a0archive. The\\u00a0CIA replied: \\u201dWe have been working with the\\u00a0opposition in\\u00a0Russia. We believe that this is the\\u00a0right thing to\\u00a0do and\\u00a0we will keep on\\u00a0doing it.\\u201c Just ridiculous. Well, okay. We realised that it was out of\\u00a0the\\u00a0question.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Forces in\\u00a0opposition to\\u00a0you? Do you think the\\u00a0CIA is trying to\\u00a0overthrow your government?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Of\\u00a0course, they meant in\\u00a0that particular case the\\u00a0separatists, the\\u00a0terrorists who fought with us in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Caucasus. That\\u2019s who they called the\\u00a0opposition. This is the\\u00a0second point.\\nThe\\u00a0third moment, a\\u00a0very important one, is the\\u00a0moment when the\\u00a0US missile defense (ABM) system was created. The\\u00a0beginning. We persuaded for\\u00a0a\\u00a0long time not to\\u00a0do it in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States. Moreover, after I\\u00a0was invited by\\u00a0Bush Jr.\\u2019s father, Bush Sr. to\\u00a0visit his place on\\u00a0the\\u00a0ocean, I\\u00a0had a\\u00a0very serious conversation with President Bush and\\u00a0his team. I\\u00a0proposed that the\\u00a0United States, Russia and\\u00a0Europe jointly create a\\u00a0missile defense system that, we believe, if created unilaterally, threatens our security, despite the\\u00a0fact that the\\u00a0United States officially said that it was being created against missile threats from Iran. That was the\\u00a0justification for\\u00a0the\\u00a0deployment of\\u00a0the\\u00a0missile defense system. I\\u00a0suggested working together\\u00a0\\u2013 Russia, the\\u00a0United States, and\\u00a0Europe. They said it was very interesting. They asked me, \\u201dAre you serious?\\u201c I\\u00a0said, \\u201cAbsolutely\\u201d.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0May I\\u00a0ask what year was this?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0I\\u00a0don\\u2019t remember. It is easy to\\u00a0find out on\\u00a0the\\u00a0Internet, when I\\u00a0was in\\u00a0the\\u00a0USA at\\u00a0the\\u00a0invitation of\\u00a0Bush Sr. It is even easier to\\u00a0learn from someone, I\\u2019m going to\\u00a0tell you about.\\nI\\u00a0was told it was very interesting. I\\u00a0said, \\u201dJust imagine if we could tackle such a\\u00a0global, strategic security challenge together. The\\u00a0world would change. We\\u2019ll probably have disputes, probably economic and\\u00a0even political ones, but we could drastically change the\\u00a0situation in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world.\\u201c He says, \\u201dYes.\\u201c And\\u00a0asks: \\u201dAre you serious?\\u201c. I\\u00a0said, \\u201dOf\\u00a0course.\\u201c \\u201dWe need to\\u00a0think about it,\\u201c I\\u2019m told. I\\u00a0said, \\u201dGo ahead, please.\\u201c\\nThen Secretary of\\u00a0Defense R.Gates, former Director of\\u00a0the\\u00a0CIA, and\\u00a0Secretary of\\u00a0State C.Rice came here, in\\u00a0this cabinet. Right here, at\\u00a0this table, they sat on\\u00a0this side. Me, the\\u00a0Foreign Minister, the\\u00a0Russian Defense Minister\\u00a0\\u2013 on\\u00a0that side. They said to\\u00a0me, \\u201dYes, we have thought about it, we agree.\\u201c I\\u00a0said, \\u201dThank God, great.\\u201c\\u00a0\\u2013 \\u201dBut with some exceptions.\\u201c\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0So, twice you\\u2019ve described US presidents making decisions and\\u00a0then being undercut by\\u00a0their agency heads. So, it sounds like you\\u2019re describing a\\u00a0system that is not run by\\u00a0the\\u00a0people who are elected, in\\u00a0your telling.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0That\\u2019s right, that\\u2019s right. In\\u00a0the\\u00a0end they just told us to\\u00a0get lost. I\\u00a0am not going to\\u00a0tell you the\\u00a0details, because I\\u00a0think it is incorrect, after all, it was a\\u00a0confidential conversation. But our proposal was declined, that\\u2019s a\\u00a0fact.\\nIt was right then when I\\u00a0said: \\u201dLook, but then we will be forced to\\u00a0take counter measures. We will create such strike systems that will certainly overcome missile defense systems.\\u201c The\\u00a0answer was: \\u201dWe are not doing this against you, and\\u00a0you do what you want, assuming that it is not against us, not against the\\u00a0United States\\u201c. I\\u00a0said, \\u201dOkay.\\u201c\\nVery well, that\\u2019s the\\u00a0way it went. And\\u00a0we created hypersonic systems, with intercontinental range, and\\u00a0we continue to\\u00a0develop them. We are now ahead of\\u00a0everyone\\u00a0\\u2013 the\\u00a0United States and\\u00a0other countries\\u00a0\\u2013 in\\u00a0terms of\\u00a0the\\u00a0development of\\u00a0hypersonic strike systems, and\\u00a0we are improving them every day.\\nBut it wasn\\u2019t us, we proposed to\\u00a0go the\\u00a0other way, and\\u00a0we were pushed back.\\nNow, about NATO\\u2019s expansion to\\u00a0the\\u00a0East. Well, we were promised, no NATO to\\u00a0the\\u00a0East, not an\\u00a0inch to\\u00a0the\\u00a0East, as\\u00a0we were told. And\\u00a0then what? They said, \\u201dWell, it\\u2019s not enshrined on\\u00a0paper, so we\\u2019ll expand.\\u201c So there were five waves of\\u00a0expansion, the\\u00a0Baltic States, the\\u00a0whole of\\u00a0Eastern Europe, and\\u00a0so on.\\nAnd\\u00a0now I\\u00a0come to\\u00a0the\\u00a0main thing: they have come to\\u00a0Ukraine ultimately. In\\u00a02008 at\\u00a0the\\u00a0summit in\\u00a0Bucharest they declared that the\\u00a0doors for\\u00a0Ukraine and\\u00a0Georgia to\\u00a0join NATO were open.\\nNow about how decisions are made there. Germany, France seemed to\\u00a0be against it as\\u00a0well as\\u00a0some other European countries. But then, as\\u00a0it turned out later, President Bush, and\\u00a0he is such a\\u00a0tough guy, a\\u00a0tough politician, as\\u00a0I\\u00a0was told later, \\u201dHe exerted pressure on\\u00a0us and\\u00a0we had to\\u00a0agree.\\u201c It\\u2019s ridiculous, it\\u2019s like kindergarten. Where are the\\u00a0guarantees? What kindergarten is this, what kind of\\u00a0people are these, who are they? You see, they were pressed, they agreed. And\\u00a0then they say, \\u201dUkraine won\\u2019t be in\\u00a0NATO, you know.\\u201c I\\u00a0say, \\u201dI\\u00a0don\\u2019t know, I\\u00a0know you agreed in\\u00a02008, why won\\u2019t you agree in\\u00a0the\\u00a0future?\\u201c \\u201dWell, they pressed us then.\\u201c I\\u00a0say, \\u201dWhy won\\u2019t they press you tomorrow? And\\u00a0you\\u2019ll agree again.\\u201c\\nWell, it\\u2019s nonsensical. Who\\u2019s there to\\u00a0talk to, I\\u00a0just don\\u2019t understand. We\\u2019re ready to\\u00a0talk. But with whom? Where are the\\u00a0guarantees? None.\\nSo, they started to\\u00a0develop the\\u00a0territory of\\u00a0Ukraine. Whatever is there, I\\u00a0have told you the\\u00a0background, how this territory developed, what kind of\\u00a0relations there were with Russia. Every second or\\u00a0third person there has always had some ties with Russia. And\\u00a0during the\\u00a0elections in\\u00a0already independent, sovereign Ukraine, which gained its independence as\\u00a0a\\u00a0result of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Declaration of\\u00a0Independence, and, by\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, it says that Ukraine is a\\u00a0neutral state, and\\u00a0in\\u00a02008 suddenly the\\u00a0doors or\\u00a0gates to\\u00a0NATO were open to\\u00a0it. Oh, come on! This is not how we agreed. Now, all the\\u00a0presidents that have come to\\u00a0power in\\u00a0Ukraine, they\\u2019ve relied on\\u00a0an\\u00a0electorate with a\\u00a0good attitude to\\u00a0Russia in\\u00a0one way or\\u00a0another. This is the\\u00a0south-east of\\u00a0Ukraine, this is a\\u00a0large number of\\u00a0people. And\\u00a0it was very difficult to\\u00a0desuade this electorate, which had a\\u00a0positive attitude towards Russia.\\nViktor Yanukovych came to\\u00a0power, and\\u00a0how: the\\u00a0first time he won after President Kuchma\\u00a0\\u2013 they organised a\\u00a0third round, which is not provided for\\u00a0in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Constitution of\\u00a0Ukraine. This is a\\u00a0coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat. Just imagine, someone in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States wouldn\\u2019t like the\\u00a0outcome\\u2026\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0In\\u00a02014?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Before that. No, this was before that. After President Kuchma, Viktor Yanukovich won the\\u00a0elections. However, his opponents did not recognize that victory, the\\u00a0US supported the\\u00a0opposition and\\u00a0the\\u00a0third round was scheduled. What is this? This is a\\u00a0coup. The\\u00a0US supported it and\\u00a0the\\u00a0winner of\\u00a0the\\u00a0third round came to\\u00a0power. Imagine if in\\u00a0the\\u00a0US, something was not to\\u00a0someone\\u2019s liking and\\u00a0the\\u00a0third round of\\u00a0election, which the\\u00a0US Constitution does not provide for, was organized, Nonetheless, it was done in\\u00a0Ukraine. Okay, Viktor Yushchenko who was considered a\\u00a0pro-Western politician, came to\\u00a0power. Fine, we have built relations with him as\\u00a0well. He came to\\u00a0Moscow with visits, we visited Kiev. I\\u00a0visited it too. We met in\\u00a0an\\u00a0informal setting. If he is pro-Western, so be it. It\\u2019s fine, let people do their job. The\\u00a0situation should develop inside the\\u00a0independent Ukraine itself. As\\u00a0a\\u00a0result of\\u00a0Kuchma\\u2019s leadership, things got worse and\\u00a0Viktor Yanukovich came to\\u00a0power after all.\\nMaybe he wasn\\u2019t the\\u00a0best President and\\u00a0politician. I\\u00a0don\\u2019t know, I\\u00a0don\\u2019t want to\\u00a0give assessments. However, the\\u00a0issue of\\u00a0the\\u00a0association with the\\u00a0EU came up. We have always been lenient to\\u00a0this: suit yourself. But when we read through that treaty of\\u00a0association it turned out to\\u00a0be a\\u00a0problem for\\u00a0us, since we had a\\u00a0free-trade zone and\\u00a0open customs borders with Ukraine which, under this association, had to\\u00a0open its borders for\\u00a0Europe, which could have led to\\u00a0flooding of\\u00a0our market.\\nWe said, \\u201cNo, this is not going to\\u00a0work. We shall close our borders with Ukraine then\\u201d. The\\u00a0customs borders, that is. Yanukovich started to\\u00a0calculate how much Ukraine was going to\\u00a0gain, how much to\\u00a0lose and\\u00a0said to\\u00a0his European partners: \\u201cI\\u00a0need more time to\\u00a0think before signing\\u201d. The\\u00a0moment he said that, the\\u00a0opposition began to\\u00a0take destructive steps which were supported by\\u00a0the\\u00a0West. It all came down to\\u00a0Maidan and\\u00a0a\\u00a0coup in\\u00a0Ukraine.\\n\\n\\n\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0So, he did more trade with Russia than with the\\u00a0EU? Ukraine did\\u2026\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Of\\u00a0course. It\\u2019s not even the\\u00a0matter of\\u00a0trade volume, although for\\u00a0the\\u00a0most part it is. It is the\\u00a0matter of\\u00a0cooperation ties which the\\u00a0entire Ukrainian economy was based on. The\\u00a0cooperation ties between the\\u00a0enterprises were very close since the\\u00a0times of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union. One enterprise there used to\\u00a0produce components to\\u00a0be assembled both in\\u00a0Russia and\\u00a0Ukraine and\\u00a0vice versa. There used to\\u00a0be very close ties.\\nA\\u00a0coup d\\u2019etat was committed, although, I\\u00a0shall not delve into details now as\\u00a0I\\u00a0find doing it inappropriate, the\\u00a0US told us, \\u201cCalm Yanukovich down and\\u00a0we will calm the\\u00a0opposition. Let the\\u00a0situation unfold in\\u00a0the\\u00a0scenario of\\u00a0a\\u00a0political settlement\\u201d. We said, \\u201cAlright. Agreed. Let\\u2019s do it this way\\u201d. As\\u00a0the\\u00a0Americans requested us, Yanukovich did use neither the\\u00a0Armed Forces, nor the\\u00a0police, yet the\\u00a0armed opposition committed a\\u00a0coup in\\u00a0Kiev. What is that supposed to\\u00a0mean? \\u201cWho do you think you are?\\u201d, I\\u00a0wanted to\\u00a0ask the\\u00a0then US leadership.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0With the\\u00a0backing of\\u00a0whom?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0With the\\u00a0backing of\\u00a0CIA, of\\u00a0course. The\\u00a0organization you wanted to\\u00a0join back in\\u00a0the\\u00a0day, as\\u00a0I\\u00a0understand. Maybe we should thank God they didn\\u2019t let you in. Although, it is a\\u00a0serious organization. I\\u00a0understand. My\\u00a0former vis-\\u00e0-vis, in\\u00a0the\\u00a0sense that I\\u00a0served in\\u00a0the\\u00a0First Main Directorate\\u00a0\\u2013 Soviet Union\\u2019s intelligence service. They have always been our opponents. A\\u00a0job is a\\u00a0job.\\nTechnically they did everything right, they achieved their goal of\\u00a0changing the\\u00a0government. However, from political standpoint, it was a\\u00a0colossal mistake. Surely, it was political leadership\\u2019s miscalculation. They should have seen what it would evolve into.\\nSo, in\\u00a02008 the\\u00a0doors of\\u00a0NATO were opened for\\u00a0Ukraine. In\\u00a02014, there was a\\u00a0coup, they started persecuting those who did not accept the\\u00a0coup, and\\u00a0it was indeed a\\u00a0coup, they created a\\u00a0threat to\\u00a0Crimea which we had to\\u00a0take under our protection. They launched a\\u00a0war in\\u00a0Donbass in\\u00a02014 with the\\u00a0use of\\u00a0aircraft and\\u00a0artillery against civilians. This is when it started. There is a\\u00a0video of\\u00a0aircraft attacking Donetsk from above. They launched a\\u00a0large-scale military operation, then another one. When they failed, they started to\\u00a0prepare the\\u00a0next one. All this against the\\u00a0background of\\u00a0military development of\\u00a0this territory and\\u00a0opening of\\u00a0NATO\\u2019s doors.\\nHow could we not express concern over what was happening? From our side, this would have been a\\u00a0culpable negligence\\u00a0\\u2013 that\\u2019s what it would have been. It\\u2019s just that the\\u00a0US political leadership pushed us to\\u00a0the\\u00a0line we could not cross because doing so could have ruined Russia itself. Besides, we could not leave our brothers in\\u00a0faith and, in\\u00a0fact, a\\u00a0part of\\u00a0Russian people, in\\u00a0the\\u00a0face of\\u00a0this \\u201cwar machine\\u201d.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0So, that was eight years before the\\u00a0current conflict started. What was the\\u00a0trigger for\\u00a0you? What was the\\u00a0moment where you decided you had to\\u00a0do this?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Initially, it was the\\u00a0coup in\\u00a0Ukraine that provoked the\\u00a0conflict.\\nBy\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, back then the\\u00a0representatives of\\u00a0three European countries\\u00a0\\u2013 Germany, Poland and\\u00a0France\\u00a0\\u2013 arrived. They were the\\u00a0guarantors of\\u00a0the\\u00a0signed agreement between the\\u00a0Government of\\u00a0Yanukovich and\\u00a0the\\u00a0opposition. They signed it as\\u00a0guarantors. Despite that, the\\u00a0opposition committed a\\u00a0coup and\\u00a0all these countries pretended that they didn\\u2019t remember that they were guarantors of\\u00a0peaceful settlement. They just threw it in\\u00a0the\\u00a0stove right away and\\u00a0nobody recalls that.\\nI\\u00a0don\\u2019t know if the\\u00a0US know anything about that agreement between the\\u00a0opposition and\\u00a0the\\u00a0authorities and\\u00a0its three guarantors who, instead of\\u00a0bringing this whole situation back in\\u00a0the\\u00a0political field, supported the\\u00a0coup. Although, it was meaningless, believe me, because President Yanukovich agreed to\\u00a0all conditions, he was ready to\\u00a0hold early election which he had no chance to\\u00a0win, frankly speaking, Everyone knew that. Then why the\\u00a0coup, why the\\u00a0victims? Why threatening Crimea? Why launching an\\u00a0operation in\\u00a0Donbass? This I\\u00a0do not understand. That is exactly what the\\u00a0miscalculation is. CIA did its job to\\u00a0complete the\\u00a0coup. I\\u00a0think one of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Deputy Secretaries of\\u00a0State said that it cost a\\u00a0large sum of\\u00a0money, almost 5 billion. But the\\u00a0political mistake was colossal! Why would they have to\\u00a0do that? All this could have been done legally, without victims, without military action, without losing Crimea. We would have never considered to\\u00a0even lift a\\u00a0finger, if it hadn\\u2019t been for\\u00a0the\\u00a0bloody developments on\\u00a0Maidan.\\nBecause we agreed with the\\u00a0fact that after the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union our borders should be along the\\u00a0borders of\\u00a0former Union\\u2019s republics. We agreed to\\u00a0that. But we never agreed to\\u00a0NATO\\u2019s expansion and\\u00a0moreover we never agreed that Ukraine would be in\\u00a0NATO. We did not agree to\\u00a0NATO bases there without any discussion with us. For\\u00a0decades we kept asking: don\\u2019t do this, don\\u2019t do that.\\nAnd\\u00a0what triggered the\\u00a0latest events? Firstly, the\\u00a0current Ukrainian leadership declared that it would not implement the\\u00a0Minsk Agreements, which had been signed, as\\u00a0you know, after the\\u00a0events of\\u00a02014, in\\u00a0Minsk, where the\\u00a0plan of\\u00a0peaceful settlement in\\u00a0Donbass was set forth. But no, the\\u00a0current Ukrainian leadership, Foreign Minister, all other officials and\\u00a0then President himself said that they don\\u2019t like anything about the\\u00a0Minsk Agreements. In\\u00a0other words, they were not going to\\u00a0implement it. A\\u00a0year or\\u00a0a\\u00a0year and\\u00a0a\\u00a0half ago, former leaders of\\u00a0Germany and\\u00a0France said openly to\\u00a0the\\u00a0whole world that they indeed signed the\\u00a0Minsk Agreements but they never intended to\\u00a0implement them. They simply led us by\\u00a0the\\u00a0nose.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Was there anyone free to\\u00a0talk to? Did you call the\\u00a0US President, Secretary of\\u00a0State and\\u00a0say if you keep militarizing Ukraine with NATO forces, we are going to\\u00a0act?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0We talked about this all the\\u00a0time. We addressed the\\u00a0United States\\u2019 and\\u00a0European countries\\u2019 leadership to\\u00a0stop these developments immediately, to\\u00a0implement the\\u00a0Minsk Agreements. Frankly speaking, I\\u00a0didn\\u2019t know how we were going to\\u00a0do this but I\\u00a0was ready to\\u00a0implement them. These Agreements were complicated for\\u00a0Ukraine; they included lots of\\u00a0elements of\\u00a0those Donbass territories\\u2019 independence. That\\u2019s true. However, I\\u00a0was absolutely confident, and\\u00a0I\\u00a0am saying this to\\u00a0you now: I\\u00a0honestly believed that if we managed to\\u00a0convince the\\u00a0residents of\\u00a0Donbass\\u00a0\\u2013 and\\u00a0we had to\\u00a0work hard to\\u00a0convince them to\\u00a0return to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Ukrainian statehood\\u00a0\\u2013 then gradually the\\u00a0wounds would start to\\u00a0heal. When this part of\\u00a0territory reintegrated itself into common social environment, when the\\u00a0pensions and\\u00a0social benefits were paid again, all the\\u00a0pieces would gradually fall into place.\\nNo, nobody wanted that, everybody wanted to\\u00a0resolve the\\u00a0issue by\\u00a0military force only. But we could not let that happen. And\\u00a0the\\u00a0situation got to\\u00a0the\\u00a0point, when the\\u00a0Ukrainian side announced: \\u201dNo, we will not do anything\\u201c. They also started preparing for\\u00a0military action. It was they who started the\\u00a0war in\\u00a02014. Our goal is to\\u00a0stop this war. And\\u00a0we did not start this war in\\u00a02022. This is an\\u00a0attempt to\\u00a0stop it.\\nTucker Carlson: Do you think you have stopped it now? I\\u00a0mean have you achieved your aims?\\nVladimir Putin: No, we haven\\u2019t achieved our aims yet, because one of\\u00a0them is denazification. This means the\\u00a0prohibition of\\u00a0all kinds of\\u00a0neo-Nazi movements. This is one of\\u00a0the\\u00a0problems that we discussed during the\\u00a0negotiation process, which ended in\\u00a0Istanbul early last year, and\\u00a0it was not our initiative, because we were told (by\\u00a0the\\u00a0Europeans, in\\u00a0particular) that \\u201dit was necessary to\\u00a0create conditions for\\u00a0the\\u00a0final signing of\\u00a0the\\u00a0documents\\u201c. My\\u00a0counterparts in\\u00a0France and\\u00a0Germany said, \\u201dHow can you imagine them signing a\\u00a0treaty with a\\u00a0gun to\\u00a0their heads? The\\u00a0troops should be pulled back from Kiev. \\u2018I\\u00a0said, \\u2018All right.\\u2019 We withdrew the\\u00a0troops from Kiev.\\nAs\\u00a0soon as\\u00a0we pulled back our troops from Kiev, our Ukrainian negotiators immediately threw all our agreements reached in\\u00a0Istanbul into the\\u00a0bin and\\u00a0got prepared for\\u00a0a\\u00a0longstanding armed confrontation with the\\u00a0help of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States and\\u00a0its satellites in\\u00a0Europe. That is how the\\u00a0situation has developed. And\\u00a0that is how it looks now.\\nTucker Carlson: What is denazification? What would that mean?\\nVladimir Putin: That is what I\\u00a0want to\\u00a0talk about right now. It is a\\u00a0very important issue.\\nDenazification. After gaining independence, Ukraine began to\\u00a0search, as\\u00a0some Western analysts say, its identity. And\\u00a0it came up with nothing better than to\\u00a0build this identity upon some false heroes who collaborated with Hitler.\\nI\\u00a0have already said that in\\u00a0the\\u00a0early 19th century, when the\\u00a0theorists of\\u00a0independence and\\u00a0sovereignty of\\u00a0Ukraine appeared, they assumed that an\\u00a0independent Ukraine should have very good relations with Russia. But due to\\u00a0the\\u00a0historical development, these territories were part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth\\u00a0\\u2013 Poland, where Ukrainians were persecuted and\\u00a0treated quite brutally as\\u00a0well as\\u00a0were subject to\\u00a0cruel behavior. There were also attempts to\\u00a0destroy their identity. All this remained in\\u00a0the\\u00a0memory of\\u00a0the\\u00a0people. When World War II broke out, part of\\u00a0this extremely nationalist elite collaborated with Hitler, believing that he would bring them freedom. The\\u00a0German troops, even the\\u00a0SS troops made Hitler\\u2019s collaborators do the\\u00a0dirtiest work of\\u00a0exterminating the\\u00a0Polish and\\u00a0Jewish population. Hence this brutal massacre of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Polish and\\u00a0Jewish population as\\u00a0well as\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian population too. This was led by\\u00a0the\\u00a0persons who are well known\\u00a0\\u2013 Bandera, Shukhevich. It was these people who were made national heroes\\u00a0\\u2013 that is the\\u00a0problem. And\\u00a0we are constantly told that nationalism and\\u00a0neo-Nazism exist in\\u00a0other countries as\\u00a0well. Yes, there are seedlings, but we uproot them, and\\u00a0other countries fight against them. But Ukraine is not the\\u00a0case. These people have been made into national heroes in\\u00a0Ukraine. Monuments to\\u00a0these people have been erected, they are displayed on\\u00a0flags, their names are shouted by\\u00a0crowds that walk with torches, as\\u00a0it was in\\u00a0Nazi Germany. These were the\\u00a0people who exterminated Poles, Jews and\\u00a0Russians. It is necessary to\\u00a0stop this practice and\\u00a0prevent the\\u00a0dissemination of\\u00a0this concept.\\nI\\u00a0say that Ukrainians are part of\\u00a0the\\u00a0one Russian people. They say, \\u201dNo, we are a\\u00a0separate people.\\u201c Okay, fine. If they consider themselves a\\u00a0separate people, they have the\\u00a0right to\\u00a0do so, but not on\\u00a0the\\u00a0basis of\\u00a0Nazism, the\\u00a0Nazi ideology.\\nTucker Carlson: Would you be satisfied with the\\u00a0territory that you have now?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0will finish answering the\\u00a0question. You just asked a\\u00a0question about neo-Nazism and\\u00a0denazification.\\nLook, the\\u00a0President of\\u00a0Ukraine visited Canada. This story is well known, but is silenced in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Western countries: The\\u00a0Canadian parliament introduced a\\u00a0man who, as\\u00a0the\\u00a0speaker of\\u00a0the\\u00a0parliament said, fought against the\\u00a0Russians during the\\u00a0World War II. Well, who fought against the\\u00a0Russians during World War II? Hitler and\\u00a0his accomplices. It turned out that this man served in\\u00a0the\\u00a0SS troops. He personally killed Russians, Poles, and\\u00a0Jews. The\\u00a0SS troops consisted of\\u00a0Ukrainian nationalists who did this dirty work. The\\u00a0President of\\u00a0Ukraine stood up with the\\u00a0entire Parliament of\\u00a0Canada and\\u00a0applauded this man. How can this be imagined? The\\u00a0President of\\u00a0Ukraine himself, by\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, is a\\u00a0Jew by\\u00a0nationality.\\nTucker Carlson: Really, my\\u00a0question is: What do you do about it? I\\u00a0mean, Hitler has been dead for\\u00a0eighty years, Nazi Germany no longer exists, and\\u00a0it\\u2019s true. So, I\\u00a0think, what you are saying, you want to\\u00a0extinguish or\\u00a0at\\u00a0least control Ukrainian nationalism. But how do you do that?\\nVladimir Putin: Listen to\\u00a0me. Your question is very subtle.\\nAnd\\u00a0can I\\u00a0tell you what I\\u00a0think? Do not take offense.\\nTucker Carlson: Of\\u00a0course!\\nVladimir Putin: This question appears to\\u00a0be subtle, it is quite pesky.\\nYou say Hitler has been dead for\\u00a0so many years, 80 years. But his example lives on. People who exterminated Jews, Russians and\\u00a0Poles are alive. And\\u00a0the\\u00a0president, the\\u00a0current president of\\u00a0today\\u2019s Ukraine applauds him in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Canadian Parliament, gives a\\u00a0standing ovation! Can we say that we have completely uprooted this ideology if what we see is happening today? That is what denazification is in\\u00a0our understanding. We have to\\u00a0get rid of\\u00a0those people who maintain this concept and\\u00a0support this practice and\\u00a0try to\\u00a0preserve it\\u00a0\\u2013 that is what denazification is. That is what we mean.\\nTucker Carlson: Right. My\\u00a0question is almost specific, it was, of\\u00a0course, not a\\u00a0defense of\\u00a0Nazism. Otherwise, it was a\\u00a0practical question. You don\\u2019t control the\\u00a0entire country, you don\\u2019t seem like you want to. So, how do you eliminate that culture, or\\u00a0an\\u00a0ideology, or\\u00a0feelings, or\\u00a0a\\u00a0view of\\u00a0history, in\\u00a0a\\u00a0country that you don\\u2019t control? What do you do about that?\\nVladimir Putin: You know, as\\u00a0strange as\\u00a0it may seem to\\u00a0you, during the\\u00a0negotiations in\\u00a0Istanbul we did agree that\\u00a0\\u2013 we have it all in\\u00a0writing\\u00a0\\u2013 neo-Nazism would not be cultivated in\\u00a0Ukraine, including that it would be prohibited at\\u00a0the\\u00a0legislative level.\\nMr. Carlson, we agreed on\\u00a0that. This, it turns out, can be done during the\\u00a0negotiation process. And\\u00a0there is nothing humiliating for\\u00a0Ukraine as\\u00a0a\\u00a0modern civilized State. Is any state allowed to\\u00a0promote Nazism? It is not, is it? That is it.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Will there be talks? And\\u00a0why haven\\u2019t there been talks about resolving the\\u00a0conflict in\\u00a0Ukraine? Peace talks.\\nVladimir Putin: They have been. They reached a\\u00a0very high stage of\\u00a0coordination of\\u00a0positions in\\u00a0a\\u00a0complex process, but still they were almost finalized. But after we withdrew our troops from Kiev, as\\u00a0I\\u00a0have already said, the\\u00a0other side (Ukraine) threw away all these agreements and\\u00a0obeyed the\\u00a0instructions of\\u00a0Western countries, European countries and\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States to\\u00a0fight Russia to\\u00a0the\\u00a0bitter end.\\nMoreover, the\\u00a0President of\\u00a0Ukraine has legislated a\\u00a0ban on\\u00a0negotiating with Russia. He signed a\\u00a0decree forbidding everyone to\\u00a0negotiate with Russia. But how are we going to\\u00a0negotiate if he forbade himself and\\u00a0everyone to\\u00a0do this? We know that he is putting forward some ideas about this settlement. But in\\u00a0order to\\u00a0agree on\\u00a0something, we need to\\u00a0have a\\u00a0dialog. Is not that right?\\nTucker Carlson: Well, but you would not be speaking to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Ukrainian president, you would be speaking to\\u00a0the\\u00a0American president. When was the\\u00a0last time you spoke to\\u00a0Joe Biden?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0cannot remember when I\\u00a0talked to\\u00a0him. I\\u00a0do not remember, we can look it up.\\nTucker Carlson: You do not remember?!\\nVladimir Putin: No, why? Do I\\u00a0have to\\u00a0remember everything? I\\u00a0have my\\u00a0own things to\\u00a0do. We have domestic political affairs.\\nTucker Carlson: But he is funding the\\u00a0war that you are fighting, so I\\u00a0think that would be memorable?\\nVladimir Putin: Well, yes, he funds, but I\\u00a0talked to\\u00a0him before the\\u00a0Special Military Operation, of\\u00a0course. And\\u00a0I\\u00a0said to\\u00a0him then, by\\u00a0the\\u00a0way\\u00a0\\u2013 I\\u00a0will not go into details, I\\u00a0never do\\u00a0\\u2013 but I\\u00a0said to\\u00a0him then: \\u201dI\\u00a0believe that you are making a\\u00a0huge mistake of\\u00a0historic proportions by\\u00a0supporting everything that is happening there, in\\u00a0Ukraine, by\\u00a0pushing Russia away.\\u201c I\\u00a0told him, told him repeatedly, by\\u00a0the\\u00a0way. I\\u00a0think that would be correct if I\\u00a0stop here.\\nTucker Carlson: What did he say?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Ask him, please. It is easier for\\u00a0you, you are a\\u00a0citizen of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, go and\\u00a0ask him. It is not appropriate for\\u00a0me to\\u00a0comment on\\u00a0our conversation.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0But you haven\\u2019t spoken to\\u00a0him since before February of\\u00a02022?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0No, we haven\\u2019t spoken. Certain contacts are been maintained though. Speaking of\\u00a0which, do you remember what I\\u00a0told you about my\\u00a0proposal to\\u00a0work together on\\u00a0a\\u00a0missile defense system?\\n\\n\\n\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Yes.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You can ask all of\\u00a0them. All of\\u00a0them are safe and\\u00a0sound, thank God. The\\u00a0former President, Condoleezza is safe and\\u00a0sound, and, I\\u00a0think, Mr. Gates, and\\u00a0the\\u00a0current Director of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Burns, the\\u00a0then Ambassador to\\u00a0Russia, in\\u00a0my\\u00a0opinion, a\\u00a0very successful Ambassador. They were all witnesses to\\u00a0these conversations. Ask them.\\nSame here, if you are interested in\\u00a0what Mr. President Biden responded to\\u00a0me, ask him. At\\u00a0any rate, I\\u00a0talked to\\u00a0him about it.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0I\\u00a0am definitely interested. But from the\\u00a0other side it seems like it could devolve, evolve into something that brings the\\u00a0entire world into conflict, and\\u00a0could initiate a\\u00a0nuclear launch, and\\u00a0so why don\\u2019t you just call Biden and\\u00a0say \\u201clet\\u2019s work this out\\u201d?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0What\\u2019s there to\\u00a0work out? It\\u2019s very simple. I\\u00a0repeat, we have contacts through various agencies. I\\u00a0will tell you what we are saying on\\u00a0this matter and\\u00a0what we are conveying to\\u00a0the\\u00a0US leadership: \\u201dIf you really want to\\u00a0stop fighting, you need to\\u00a0stop supplying weapons. It will be over within a\\u00a0few weeks. That\\u2019s it. And\\u00a0then we can agree on\\u00a0some terms before you do that, stop.\\u201c\\nWhat\\u2019s easier? Why would I\\u00a0call him? What should I\\u00a0talk to\\u00a0him about? Or\\u00a0beg him for\\u00a0what? \\u201dYou\\u2019re going to\\u00a0deliver such and\\u00a0such weapons to\\u00a0Ukraine. Oh, I\\u2019m afraid, I\\u2019m afraid, please don\\u2019t.\\u201c What is there to\\u00a0talk about?\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Do you think NATO was worried about this becoming a\\u00a0global war or\\u00a0nuclear conflict?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0At\\u00a0least that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re talking about. And\\u00a0they are trying to\\u00a0intimidate their own population with an\\u00a0imaginary Russian threat. This is an\\u00a0obvious fact. And\\u00a0thinking people, not philistines, but thinking people, analysts, those who are engaged in\\u00a0real politics, just smart people understand perfectly well that this is a\\u00a0fake. They are trying to\\u00a0fuel the\\u00a0Russian threat.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0The\\u00a0threat I\\u00a0think you were referring to\\u00a0is Russian invasion of\\u00a0Poland, Latvia\\u00a0\\u2013 expansionist behavior. Can you imagine a\\u00a0scenario where you send Russian troops to\\u00a0Poland?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Only in\\u00a0one case: if Poland attacks Russia. Why? Because we have no interest in\\u00a0Poland, Latvia or\\u00a0anywhere else. Why would we do that? We simply don\\u2019t have any interest. Its just threat mongering.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Well, the\\u00a0argument, I\\u00a0know you know this, is that, well, he invaded Ukraine\\u00a0\\u2013 he has territorial aims across the\\u00a0continent. And\\u00a0you are saying unequivocally, you don\\u2019t?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0It is absolutely out of\\u00a0the\\u00a0question. You just don\\u2019t have to\\u00a0be any kind of\\u00a0analyst, it goes against common sense to\\u00a0get involved in\\u00a0some kind of\\u00a0global war. And\\u00a0a\\u00a0global war will bring all of\\u00a0humanity to\\u00a0the\\u00a0brink of\\u00a0destruction. It\\u2019s obvious.\\nThere are, certainly, means of\\u00a0deterrence. They have been scaring everyone with us all along: tomorrow Russia will use tactical nuclear weapons, tomorrow Russia will use that, no, the\\u00a0day after tomorrow. So what? These are just horror stories for\\u00a0people in\\u00a0the\\u00a0street in\\u00a0order to\\u00a0extort additional money from US taxpayers and\\u00a0European taxpayers in\\u00a0the\\u00a0confrontation with Russia in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Ukrainian theatre of\\u00a0war. The\\u00a0goal is to\\u00a0weaken Russia as\\u00a0much as\\u00a0possible.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0One of\\u00a0our senior United States senators from the\\u00a0State of\\u00a0New York, Chuck Schumer, said yesterday, I\\u00a0believe, that we have to\\u00a0continue to\\u00a0fund the\\u00a0Ukrainian effort or\\u00a0US soldiers, citizens could wind up fighting there. How do you assess that?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0This is a\\u00a0provocation, and\\u00a0a\\u00a0cheap provocation at\\u00a0that.\\nI\\u00a0do not understand why American soldiers should fight in\\u00a0Ukraine. There are mercenaries from the\\u00a0United States there. The\\u00a0biggest number of\\u00a0mercenaries comes from Poland, with mercenaries from the\\u00a0United States in\\u00a0second place, and\\u00a0mercenaries from Georgia in\\u00a0third place. Well, if somebody has the\\u00a0desire to\\u00a0send regular troops, that would certainly bring humanity on\\u00a0the\\u00a0brink of\\u00a0a\\u00a0very serious, global conflict. This is obvious.\\nDo the\\u00a0United States need this? What for? Thousands of\\u00a0miles away from your national territory! Don\\u2019t you have anything better to\\u00a0do?\\nYou have issues on\\u00a0the\\u00a0border, issues with migration, issues with the\\u00a0national debt\\u00a0\\u2013 more than 33 trillion dollars. You have nothing better to\\u00a0do, so you should fight in\\u00a0Ukraine? Wouldn\\u2019t it be better to\\u00a0negotiate with Russia? Make an\\u00a0agreement, already understanding the\\u00a0situation that is developing today, realizing that Russia will fight for\\u00a0its interests to\\u00a0the\\u00a0end. And, realizing this, actually return to\\u00a0common sense, start respecting our country and\\u00a0its interests and\\u00a0look for\\u00a0certain solutions. It seems to\\u00a0me that this is much smarter and\\u00a0more rational.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Who blew up Nord Stream?\\nVladimir Putin: You, for sure. (Laughing.)\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0I\\u00a0was busy that day. I\\u00a0did not blow up Nord Stream.\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You personally may have an\\u00a0alibi, but the\\u00a0CIA has no such alibi.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Do you have evidence that NATO or\\u00a0CIA did it?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You know, I\\u00a0won\\u2019t get into details, but people always say in\\u00a0such cases: \\u201dLook for\\u00a0someone who is interested\\u201c. But in\\u00a0this case we should not only look for\\u00a0someone who is interested, but also for\\u00a0someone who has capabilities. Because there may be many people interested, but not all of\\u00a0them are capable of\\u00a0sinking to\\u00a0the\\u00a0bottom of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Baltic Sea and\\u00a0carrying out this explosion. These two components should be connected: who is interested and\\u00a0who is capable of\\u00a0doing it.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0But I\\u00a0am confused. I\\u00a0mean, that\\u2019s the\\u00a0biggest act of\\u00a0industrial terrorism ever and\\u00a0it\\u2019s the\\u00a0largest emission of\\u00a0CO\\u2082 in\\u00a0history. Okay, so, if you had evidence and\\u00a0presumably, given your security services, your intel services, you would, that NATO, the\\u00a0US, CIA, the\\u00a0West did this, why wouldn\\u2019t you present it and\\u00a0win a\\u00a0propaganda victory?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0In\\u00a0the\\u00a0war of\\u00a0propaganda it is very difficult to\\u00a0defeat the\\u00a0United States because the\\u00a0United States controls all the\\u00a0world\\u2019s media and\\u00a0many European media. The\\u00a0ultimate beneficiary of\\u00a0the\\u00a0biggest European media are American financial institutions. Don\\u2019t you know that? So it is possible to\\u00a0get involved in\\u00a0this work, but it is cost prohibitive, so to\\u00a0speak. We can simply shine the\\u00a0spotlight on\\u00a0our sources of\\u00a0information, and\\u00a0we will not achieve results. It is clear to\\u00a0the\\u00a0whole world what happened, and\\u00a0even American analysts talk about it directly. It\\u2019s true.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Yes. But here is a\\u00a0question you may be able to\\u00a0answer. You worked in\\u00a0Germany, famously. The\\u00a0Germans clearly know that their NATO partner did this, that they damaged their economy greatly\\u00a0\\u2013 it may never recover. Why are they being silent about it? That is very confusing to\\u00a0me. Why wouldn\\u2019t the\\u00a0Germans say something about it?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0This also confuses me. But today\\u2019s German leadership is guided by\\u00a0the\\u00a0interests of\\u00a0the\\u00a0collective West rather than its national interests, otherwise it is difficult to\\u00a0explain the\\u00a0logic of\\u00a0their action or\\u00a0inaction. After all, it is not only about Nord Stream-1, which was blown up, and\\u00a0Nord Stream-2 was damaged, but one pipe is safe and\\u00a0sound, and\\u00a0gas can be supplied to\\u00a0Europe through it, but Germany does not open it. We are ready, please.\\nThere is another route through Poland, called Yamal-Europe, which also allows for\\u00a0a\\u00a0large flow. Poland has closed it, but Poland pecks from the\\u00a0German hand, it receives money from pan-European funds, and\\u00a0Germany is the\\u00a0main donor to\\u00a0these pan-European funds. Germany feeds Poland to\\u00a0a\\u00a0certain extent. And\\u00a0they closed the\\u00a0route to\\u00a0Germany. Why? I\\u00a0don\\u2019t understand. Ukraine, to\\u00a0which the\\u00a0Germans supply weapons and\\u00a0give money.\\nGermany is the\\u00a0second sponsor after the\\u00a0United States in\\u00a0terms of\\u00a0financial aid to\\u00a0Ukraine. There are two gas routes through Ukraine. They simply closed one route, the\\u00a0Ukrainians. Open the\\u00a0second route and, please, get gas from Russia. They do not open it. Why don\\u2019t the\\u00a0Germans say: \\u201dLook, guys, we give you money and\\u00a0weapons. Open up the\\u00a0valve, please, let the\\u00a0gas from Russia pass through for\\u00a0us.\\nWe are buying liquefied gas at\\u00a0exorbitant prices in\\u00a0Europe, which brings the\\u00a0level of\\u00a0our competitiveness, and\\u00a0economy in\\u00a0general down to\\u00a0zero. Do you want us to\\u00a0give you money? Let us have a\\u00a0decent existence, make money for\\u00a0our economy, because this is where the\\u00a0money we give you comes from\\u201c. They refuse to\\u00a0do so. Why? Ask them. (Knocks on\\u00a0the\\u00a0table.) That is what it is like in\\u00a0their heads. Those are highly incompetent people.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Well, maybe the\\u00a0world is breaking into two hemispheres. One with cheap energy, the\\u00a0other without it. And\\u00a0I\\u00a0want to\\u00a0ask you that, if we are now a\\u00a0multipolar world, obviously we are, can you describe the\\u00a0blocs of\\u00a0alliances? Who is in\\u00a0each side, do you think?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Listen, you have said that the\\u00a0world is breaking into two hemispheres. A\\u00a0human brain is divided into two hemispheres: one is responsible for\\u00a0one type of\\u00a0activities, the\\u00a0other one is more about creativity and\\u00a0so on. But it is still one and\\u00a0the\\u00a0same head. The\\u00a0world should be a\\u00a0single whole, security should be shared, rather than meant for\\u00a0the\\u00a0\\u201dgolden billion\\u201c. That is the\\u00a0only scenario where the\\u00a0world could be stable, sustainable and\\u00a0predictable. Until then, while the\\u00a0head is split into two parts, it is an\\u00a0illness, a\\u00a0serious adverse condition. It is a\\u00a0period of\\u00a0a\\u00a0severe disease that the\\u00a0world is now going through.\\nBut I\\u00a0think that, thanks to\\u00a0honest journalism\\u00a0\\u2014 this work is akin to\\u00a0work of\\u00a0the\\u00a0doctors, this could somehow be remedied.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Well, let\\u2019s just give one example\\u00a0\\u2014 the\\u00a0US dollar, which has, kind of, united the\\u00a0world in\\u00a0a\\u00a0lot of\\u00a0ways, maybe not to\\u00a0your advantage, but certainly to\\u00a0ours. Is that going away as\\u00a0the\\u00a0reserve currency, the\\u00a0universally accepted currency? How have sanctions, do you think, changed the\\u00a0dollar\\u2019s place in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You know, to\\u00a0use the\\u00a0dollar as\\u00a0a\\u00a0tool of\\u00a0foreign policy struggle is one of\\u00a0the\\u00a0biggest strategic mistakes made by\\u00a0the\\u00a0US political leadership. The\\u00a0dollar is the\\u00a0cornerstone of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States\\u2019 power. I\\u00a0think everyone understands very well that, no matter how many dollars are printed, they are quickly dispersed all over the\\u00a0world. Inflation in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States is minimal. It is about 3 or\\u00a03.4\\u00a0per cent, which is, I\\u00a0think, totally acceptable for\\u00a0the\\u00a0US. But they won\\u2019t stop printing. What does the\\u00a0debt of\\u00a033 trillion dollars tell us about? It is about the\\u00a0emission.\\nNevertheless, it is the\\u00a0main weapon used by\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States to\\u00a0preserve its power across the\\u00a0world. As\\u00a0soon as\\u00a0the\\u00a0political leadership decided to\\u00a0use the\\u00a0US dollar as\\u00a0a\\u00a0tool of\\u00a0political struggle, a\\u00a0blow was dealt to\\u00a0this American power. I\\u00a0would not like to\\u00a0use any strong language, but it is a\\u00a0stupid thing to\\u00a0do, and\\u00a0a\\u00a0grave mistake.\\nLook at\\u00a0what is going on\\u00a0in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world. Even the\\u00a0United States\\u2019 allies are now downsizing their dollar reserves. Seeing this, everyone starts looking for\\u00a0ways to\\u00a0protect themselves. But the\\u00a0fact that the\\u00a0United States applies restrictive measures to\\u00a0certain countries, such as\\u00a0placing restrictions on\\u00a0transactions, freezing assets, etc., causes grave concern and\\u00a0sends a\\u00a0signal to\\u00a0the\\u00a0whole world.\\nWhat did we have here? Until 2022, about 80\\u00a0per cent of\\u00a0Russia\\u2019s foreign trade transactions were made in\\u00a0US dollars and\\u00a0euros. US dollars accounted for\\u00a0approximately 50 per cent of\\u00a0our transactions with third countries, while currently it is down to\\u00a013 per cent. It was not us who banned the\\u00a0use of\\u00a0the\\u00a0US dollar, we had no such intention. It was the\\u00a0decision of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States to\\u00a0restrict our transactions in\\u00a0US dollars. I\\u00a0think it is a\\u00a0complete foolishness from the\\u00a0point of\\u00a0view of\\u00a0the\\u00a0interests of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States itself and\\u00a0its tax payers, as\\u00a0it damages the\\u00a0US economy, undermines the\\u00a0power of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States across the\\u00a0world.\\nBy\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, our transactions in\\u00a0Yuan accounted for\\u00a0about 3 per cent. Today, 34 per cent of\\u00a0our transactions are made in\\u00a0Rubles, and\\u00a0about as\\u00a0much, a\\u00a0little over 34 per cent, in\\u00a0Yuan.\\nWhy did the\\u00a0United States do this? My\\u00a0only guess is self-conceit. They probably thought it would lead to\\u00a0a\\u00a0full collapse, but nothing collapsed. Moreover, other countries, including oil producers, are thinking of\\u00a0and\\u00a0already accepting payments for\\u00a0oil in\\u00a0yuan. Do you even realize what is going on\\u00a0or\\u00a0not? Does anyone in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States realize this? What are you doing? You are cutting yourself off\\u2026 all experts say this. Ask any intelligent and\\u00a0thinking person in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States what the\\u00a0dollar means for\\u00a0the\\u00a0US? You are killing it with your own hands.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0I\\u00a0think that is a\\u00a0fair assessment. The\\u00a0question is what comes next? And\\u00a0maybe you trade one colonial power for\\u00a0another, much less sentimental and\\u00a0forgiving colonial power? Is the\\u00a0BRICS, for\\u00a0example, in\\u00a0danger of\\u00a0being completely dominated by\\u00a0the\\u00a0Chinese economy? In\\u00a0a\\u00a0way that is not good for\\u00a0their sovereignty. Do you worry about that?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0We have heard those boogeyman stories before. It is a\\u00a0boogeyman story. We are neighbours with China. You cannot choose neighbours, just as\\u00a0you cannot choose close relatives. We share a\\u00a0border of\\u00a01000 kilometers with them. This is number one.\\nSecond, we have a\\u00a0centuries-long history of\\u00a0coexistence, we are used to\\u00a0it.\\nThird, China\\u2019s foreign policy philosophy is not aggressive, its idea is to\\u00a0always look for\\u00a0compromise, and\\u00a0we can see that.\\nThe\\u00a0next point is as\\u00a0follows. We are always told the\\u00a0same boogeyman story, and\\u00a0here it goes again, though in\\u00a0a\\u00a0euphemistic form, but it is still the\\u00a0same bogeyman story: the\\u00a0cooperation with China keeps increasing. The\\u00a0pace at\\u00a0which China\\u2019s cooperation with Europe is growing is higher and\\u00a0greater than that of\\u00a0the\\u00a0growth of\\u00a0Chinese-Russian cooperation. Ask Europeans: aren\\u2019t they afraid? They might be, I\\u00a0do not know, but they are still trying to\\u00a0access China\\u2019s market at\\u00a0all costs, especially now that they are facing economic problems. Chinese businesses are also exploring the\\u00a0European market.\\nDo Chinese businesses have small presence in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States? Yes, the\\u00a0political decisions are such that they are trying to\\u00a0limit their cooperation with China.\\nIt is to\\u00a0your own detriment, Mr Tucker, that you are limiting cooperation with China, you are hurting yourself. It is a\\u00a0delicate matter, and\\u00a0there are no silver bullet solutions, just as\\u00a0it is with the\\u00a0dollar.\\nSo, before introducing any illegitimate sanctions\\u00a0\\u2014 illegitimate in\\u00a0terms of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Charter of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United Nations\\u00a0\\u2014 one should think very carefully. For\\u00a0decision-makers, this appears to\\u00a0be a\\u00a0problem.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0So, you said a\\u00a0moment ago that the\\u00a0world would be a\\u00a0lot better if it were not broken into competing alliances, if there was cooperation globally. One of\\u00a0the\\u00a0reasons you don\\u2019t have that is because the\\u00a0current American administration is dead set against you. Do you think if there was a\\u00a0new administration after Joe Biden that you would be able to\\u00a0re-establish communication with the\\u00a0US government? Or\\u00a0does it not matter who the\\u00a0President is?\\n\\n\\n\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0I\\u00a0will tell you. But let me finish the\\u00a0previous thought. We, together with my\\u00a0colleague and\\u00a0friend President Xi Jinping, set a\\u00a0goal to\\u00a0reach 200 billion dollars of\\u00a0mutual trade with China this year. We have exceeded this level. According to\\u00a0our figures, our bilateral trade with China totals already 230 billion, and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Chinese statistics says it is 240 billion dollars.\\nOne more important thing: our trade is well-balanced, mutually complementary in\\u00a0high-tech, energy, scientific research and\\u00a0development. It is very balanced.\\nAs\\u00a0for\\u00a0BRICS, where Russia took over the\\u00a0presidency this year, the\\u00a0BRICS countries are, by\\u00a0and\\u00a0large, developing very rapidly.\\nLook, if memory serves me right, back in\\u00a01992, the\\u00a0share of\\u00a0the\\u00a0G7 countries in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world economy amounted to\\u00a047 per cent, whereas in\\u00a02022 it was down to, I\\u00a0think, a\\u00a0little over 30 per cent. The\\u00a0BRICS countries accounted for\\u00a0only 16 per cent in\\u00a01992, but now their share is greater than that of\\u00a0the\\u00a0G7. It has nothing to\\u00a0do with the\\u00a0events in\\u00a0Ukraine. This is due to\\u00a0the\\u00a0trends of\\u00a0global development and\\u00a0world economy that I\\u00a0mentioned just now, and\\u00a0this is inevitable. This will keep happening, it is like the\\u00a0rise of\\u00a0the\\u00a0sun\\u00a0\\u2014 you cannot prevent the\\u00a0sun from rising, you have to\\u00a0adapt to\\u00a0it. How do the\\u00a0United States adapt? With the\\u00a0help of\\u00a0force: sanctions, pressure, bombings, and\\u00a0use of\\u00a0armed forces.\\nThis is about self-conceit. Your political establishment does not understand that the\\u00a0world is changing (under objective circumstances), and\\u00a0in\\u00a0order to\\u00a0preserve your level\\u00a0\\u2014 even if someone aspires, pardon me, to\\u00a0the\\u00a0level of\\u00a0dominance\\u00a0\\u2014 you have to\\u00a0make the\\u00a0right decisions in\\u00a0a\\u00a0competent and\\u00a0timely manner.\\nSuch brutal actions, including with regard to\\u00a0Russia and, say, other countries, are counterproductive. This is an\\u00a0obvious fact; it has already become evident.\\nYou just asked me if another leader comes and\\u00a0changes something. It is not about the\\u00a0leader, it is not about the\\u00a0personality of\\u00a0a\\u00a0particular person. I\\u00a0had a\\u00a0very good relationship with, say, Bush. I\\u00a0know that in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States he was portrayed as\\u00a0some kind of\\u00a0a\\u00a0country boy who does not understand much. I\\u00a0assure you that is not the\\u00a0case. I\\u00a0think he made a\\u00a0lot of\\u00a0mistakes with regard to\\u00a0Russia, too. I\\u00a0told you about 2008 and\\u00a0the\\u00a0decision in\\u00a0Bucharest to\\u00a0open the\\u00a0NATO\\u2019s doors to\\u00a0for\\u00a0Ukraine and\\u00a0so on. That happened during his presidency. He actually exercised pressure on\\u00a0the\\u00a0Europeans.\\nBut in\\u00a0general, on\\u00a0a\\u00a0personal human level, I\\u00a0had a\\u00a0very good relationship with him. He was no worse than any other American, or\\u00a0Russian, or\\u00a0European politician. I\\u00a0assure you, he understood what he was doing as\\u00a0well as\\u00a0others. I\\u00a0had such personal relationships with Trump as\\u00a0well.\\nIt is not about the\\u00a0personality of\\u00a0the\\u00a0leader, it is about the\\u00a0elites\\u2019 mindset. If the\\u00a0idea of\\u00a0domination at\\u00a0any cost, based also on\\u00a0forceful actions, dominates the\\u00a0American society, nothing will change, it will only get worse. But if, in\\u00a0the\\u00a0end, one comes to\\u00a0the\\u00a0awareness that the\\u00a0world has been changing due to\\u00a0objective circumstances, and\\u00a0that one should be able to\\u00a0adapt to\\u00a0them in\\u00a0time, using the\\u00a0advantages that the\\u00a0U.S. still has today, then, perhaps, something may change.\\nLook, China\\u2019s economy has become the\\u00a0first economy in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world in\\u00a0purchasing power parity; in\\u00a0terms of\\u00a0volume it overtook the\\u00a0US a\\u00a0long time ago. The\\u00a0USA comes second, then India (one and\\u00a0a\\u00a0half billion people), and\\u00a0then Japan, with Russia in\\u00a0the\\u00a0fifth place. Russia was the\\u00a0first economy in\\u00a0Europe last year, despite all the\\u00a0sanctions and\\u00a0restrictions. Is this normal, from your point of\\u00a0view: sanctions, restrictions, impossibility of\\u00a0payments in\\u00a0dollars, being cut off from SWIFT services, sanctions against our ships carrying oil, sanctions against airplanes, sanctions in\\u00a0everything, everywhere? The\\u00a0largest number of\\u00a0sanctions in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world which are applied\\u00a0\\u2013 are applied against Russia. And\\u00a0we have become Europe\\u2019s first economy during this time.\\nThe\\u00a0tools that the\\u00a0US uses don\\u2019t work. Well, one has to\\u00a0think about what to\\u00a0do. If this realization comes to\\u00a0the\\u00a0ruling elites, then yes, then the\\u00a0first person of\\u00a0the\\u00a0state will act in\\u00a0anticipation of\\u00a0what the\\u00a0voters and\\u00a0the\\u00a0people who make decisions at\\u00a0various levels expect from this person. Then maybe something will change.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0But you are describing two different systems. You say that the\\u00a0leader acts in\\u00a0the\\u00a0interests of\\u00a0the\\u00a0voters, but you also say that these decisions are not made by\\u00a0the\\u00a0leader\\u00a0\\u2013 they are made by\\u00a0the\\u00a0ruling classes. You have run this country for\\u00a0so long, you have known all these American presidents. What are those power centers in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, do you think? And\\u00a0who actually makes the\\u00a0decisions?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0I\\u00a0don\\u2019t know. America is a\\u00a0complex country, conservative on\\u00a0the\\u00a0one hand, rapidly changing on\\u00a0the\\u00a0other. It\\u2019s not easy for\\u00a0us to\\u00a0sort it all out.\\nWho makes decisions in\\u00a0the\\u00a0elections\\u00a0\\u2013 is it possible to\\u00a0understand this, when each state has its own legislation, each state regulates itself, someone can be excluded from the\\u00a0elections at\\u00a0the\\u00a0state level. It is a\\u00a0two-stage electoral system, it is very difficult for\\u00a0us to\\u00a0understand it.\\nCertainly there are two parties that are dominant, the\\u00a0Republicans and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Democrats, and\\u00a0within this party system, the\\u00a0centers that make decisions, that prepare decisions.\\nThen, look, why, in\\u00a0my\\u00a0opinion, after the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union, such an\\u00a0erroneous, crude, completely unjustified policy of\\u00a0pressure was pursued against Russia? After all, this is a\\u00a0policy of\\u00a0pressure. NATO expansion, support for\\u00a0the\\u00a0separatists in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Caucasus, creation of\\u00a0a\\u00a0missile defense system\\u00a0\\u2013 these are all elements of\\u00a0pressure. Pressure, pressure, pressure.\\nThen, dragging Ukraine into NATO is all about pressure, pressure, pressure. Why? I\\u00a0think, among other things, because excessive production capacities were created. During the\\u00a0confrontation with the\\u00a0Soviet Union, there were many centers created and\\u00a0specialists on\\u00a0the\\u00a0Soviet Union, who could not do anything else. It seemed to\\u00a0them, they convinced the\\u00a0political leadership: it is necessary to\\u00a0continue \\u201dchiseling\\u201c Russia, to\\u00a0try to\\u00a0break it up, to\\u00a0create on\\u00a0this territory several quasi-state entities and\\u00a0to\\u00a0subdue them in\\u00a0a\\u00a0divided form, to\\u00a0use their combined potential for\\u00a0the\\u00a0future struggle with China. This is a\\u00a0mistake, including the\\u00a0excessive potential of\\u00a0those who worked for\\u00a0the\\u00a0confrontation with the\\u00a0Soviet Union. It is necessary to\\u00a0get rid of\\u00a0this, there should be new, fresh forces, people who look into the\\u00a0future and\\u00a0understand what is happening in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world.\\nLook at\\u00a0how Indonesia is developing? 600 million people. Where can we get away from that? Nowhere, we just have to\\u00a0assume that Indonesia will enter (it is already in) the\\u00a0club of\\u00a0the\\u00a0world\\u2019s leading economies, no matter who likes or\\u00a0dislikes it.\\nYes, we understand and\\u00a0are aware that in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, despite all the\\u00a0economic problems, the\\u00a0situation is still normal with the\\u00a0economy growing decently, the\\u00a0GDP is growing by\\u00a02.5 percent, if I\\u00a0am not mistaken.\\nBut if we want to\\u00a0ensure the\\u00a0future, then we need to\\u00a0change our approach to\\u00a0what is changing. As\\u00a0I\\u00a0already said, the\\u00a0world would nevertheless change regardless of\\u00a0how the\\u00a0developments in\\u00a0Ukraine end. The\\u00a0world is changing. In\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States themselves, experts write that the\\u00a0United States are nonetheless gradually changing their position in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world, it is your experts who write that, I\\u00a0just read them. The\\u00a0only question is how this would happen\\u00a0\\u2013 painfully and\\u00a0quickly or\\u00a0gently and\\u00a0gradually. And\\u00a0this is written by\\u00a0people who are not anti-American; they simply follow global development trends. That\\u2019s it.\\nAnd\\u00a0in\\u00a0order to\\u00a0assess them and\\u00a0change policies, we need people who think, look forward, can analyze and\\u00a0recommend certain decisions at\\u00a0the\\u00a0level of\\u00a0political leaders.\\nTucker Carlson: I\\u00a0just have to\\u00a0ask. You have said clearly that NATO expansion eastward is a\\u00a0violation of\\u00a0the\\u00a0promise you were all made in\\u00a0the\\u00a01990s. It is a\\u00a0threat to\\u00a0your country. Right before you sent troops into Ukraine the\\u00a0Vice-President of\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States spoke at\\u00a0the\\u00a0Security Conference and\\u00a0encouraged the\\u00a0President of\\u00a0Ukraine to\\u00a0join NATO. Do you think that was an\\u00a0effort to\\u00a0provoke you into military action?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0repeat once again, we have repeatedly, repeatedly proposed to\\u00a0seek a\\u00a0solution to\\u00a0the\\u00a0problems that arose in\\u00a0Ukraine after the\\u00a02014 coup d\\u2019etat through peaceful means. But no one listened to\\u00a0us. And\\u00a0moreover, the\\u00a0Ukrainian leaders who were under the\\u00a0complete US control, suddenly declared that they would not comply with the\\u00a0Minsk agreements, they disliked everything there, and\\u00a0continued military activity in\\u00a0that territory.\\nAnd\\u00a0in\\u00a0parallel, that territory was being exploited by\\u00a0NATO military structures under the\\u00a0guise of\\u00a0various personnel training and\\u00a0retraining centers. They essentially began to\\u00a0create bases there. That\\u2019s all.\\nUkraine announced that the\\u00a0Russians were (a\\u00a0law was adopted) a\\u00a0non-titular nationality, while passing laws that limit the\\u00a0rights of\\u00a0non-titular nationalities in\\u00a0Ukraine. Ukraine, having received all these southeastern territories as\\u00a0a\\u00a0gift from the\\u00a0Russian people, suddenly announced that the\\u00a0Russians were a\\u00a0non-titular nationality in\\u00a0that territory. Is it normal? All this put together led to\\u00a0the\\u00a0decision to\\u00a0end the\\u00a0war that neo-Nazis started in\\u00a0Ukraine in\\u00a02014.\\nTucker Carlson: Do you think Zelensky has the\\u00a0freedom to\\u00a0negotiate the\\u00a0settlement to\\u00a0this conflict?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0I\\u00a0don\\u2019t know the\\u00a0details, of\\u00a0course it\\u2019s difficult for\\u00a0me to\\u00a0judge, but I\\u00a0believe he has, in\\u00a0any case, he used to\\u00a0have. His father fought against the\\u00a0fascists, Nazis during World War II, I\\u00a0once talked to\\u00a0him about this. I\\u00a0said: \\u201cVolodya, what are you doing? Why are you supporting neo-Nazis in\\u00a0Ukraine today, while your father fought against fascism? He was a\\u00a0front-line soldier.\\u201d I\\u00a0will not tell you what he answered, this is a\\u00a0separate topic, and\\u00a0I\\u00a0think it\\u2019s incorrect for\\u00a0me to\\u00a0do so.\\nBut as\\u00a0to\\u00a0the\\u00a0freedom of\\u00a0choice\\u00a0\\u2013 why not? He came to\\u00a0power on\\u00a0the\\u00a0expectations of\\u00a0Ukrainian people that he would lead Ukraine to\\u00a0peace. He talked about this, it was thanks to\\u00a0this that he won the\\u00a0election overwhelmingly. But then, when he came to\\u00a0power, in\\u00a0my\\u00a0opinion, he realized two things: firstly, it is better not to\\u00a0clash with neo-Nazis and\\u00a0nationalists, because they are aggressive and\\u00a0very active, you can expect anything from them, and\\u00a0secondly, the\\u00a0US-led West supports them and\\u00a0will always support those who antagonize with Russia\\u00a0\\u2013 it is beneficial and\\u00a0safe. So he took the\\u00a0relevant position, despite promising his people to\\u00a0end the\\u00a0war in\\u00a0Ukraine. He deceived his voters.\\nTucker Carlson: But do you think at\\u00a0this point\\u00a0\\u2013 as\\u00a0of\\u00a0February 2024\\u00a0\\u2013 he has the\\u00a0latitude, the\\u00a0freedom to\\u00a0speak with you or\\u00a0government directly, which would clearly help his country or\\u00a0the\\u00a0world? Can he do that, do you think?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Why not? He considers himself head of\\u00a0state, he won the\\u00a0elections. Although we believe in\\u00a0Russia that the\\u00a0coup d\\u2019etat is the\\u00a0primary source of\\u00a0power for\\u00a0everything that happened after 2014, and\\u00a0in\\u00a0this sense, even today\\u2019s government is flawed. But he considers himself the\\u00a0president, and\\u00a0he is recognized by\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, all of\\u00a0Europe and\\u00a0practically the\\u00a0rest of\\u00a0the\\u00a0world in\\u00a0such a\\u00a0capacity\\u00a0\\u2013 why not? He can.\\nWe negotiated with Ukraine in\\u00a0Istanbul, we agreed, he was aware of\\u00a0this. Moreover, the\\u00a0negotiation group leader, Mr. Arakhamia is his last name, I\\u00a0believe, still heads the\\u00a0faction of\\u00a0the\\u00a0ruling party, the\\u00a0party of\\u00a0the\\u00a0President in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Rada. He still heads the\\u00a0Presidential faction in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Rada, the\\u00a0country\\u2019s parliament, he still sits there. He even put his preliminary signature on\\u00a0the\\u00a0document I\\u00a0am telling you about. But then he publicly stated to\\u00a0the\\u00a0whole world: \\u201cWe were ready to\\u00a0sign this document, but Mr. Johnson, then the\\u00a0Prime Minister of\\u00a0Great Britain, came and\\u00a0dissuaded us from doing this saying it was better to\\u00a0fight Russia. They would give everything needed for\\u00a0us to\\u00a0return what was lost during the\\u00a0clashes with Russia. And\\u00a0we agreed with this proposal.\\u201c Look, his statement has been published. He said this publicly.\\nCan they return to\\u00a0this or\\u00a0not? The\\u00a0question is: do they want it or\\u00a0not?\\nFurther on, President of\\u00a0Ukraine issued a\\u00a0decree prohibiting negotiations with us. Let him cancel that decree and\\u00a0that\\u2019s it. We have never refused negotiations indeed. We hear all the\\u00a0time: is Russia ready? Yes, we have not refused! It was them who publicly refused. Well, let him cancel his decree and\\u00a0enter into negotiations. We have never refused.\\nAnd\\u00a0the\\u00a0fact that they obeyed the\\u00a0demand or\\u00a0persuasion of\\u00a0Mr. Johnson, the\\u00a0former Prime Minister of\\u00a0Great Britain, seems ridiculous and\\u00a0very sad to\\u00a0me. Because, as\\u00a0Mr. Arakhamia put it: \\u201cWe could have stopped these hostilities, this war a\\u00a0year and\\u00a0a\\u00a0half ago already. But the\\u00a0British persuaded us, and\\u00a0we refused this.\\u201d Where is Mr. Johnson now? And\\u00a0the\\u00a0war continues.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0That is a\\u00a0good question. Why did he do that?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0Hell knows. I\\u00a0don\\u2019t understand it myself. There was a\\u00a0general starting point. For\\u00a0some reason, everyone had the\\u00a0illusion that Russia could be defeated on\\u00a0the\\u00a0battlefield. Because of\\u00a0arrogance, because of\\u00a0a\\u00a0pure heart, but not because of\\u00a0a\\u00a0great mind.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0You have described the\\u00a0connection between Russia and\\u00a0Ukraine; you have described Russia itself, a\\u00a0couple of\\u00a0times as\\u00a0Orthodox\\u00a0\\u2013 that is central to\\u00a0your understanding of\\u00a0Russia. What does that mean for\\u00a0you? You are a\\u00a0Cristian leader by\\u00a0your own description. So what effect does that have on\\u00a0you?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0You know, as\\u00a0I\\u00a0already mentioned, in\\u00a0988 Prince Vladimir himself was baptized following the\\u00a0example of\\u00a0his grandmother, Princess Olga, and\\u00a0then he baptized his squad, and\\u00a0then gradually, over the\\u00a0course of\\u00a0several years, he baptized all the\\u00a0Rus. It was a\\u00a0lengthy process\\u00a0\\u2013 from pagans to\\u00a0Christians, it took many years. But in\\u00a0the\\u00a0end, this Orthodoxy, Eastern Christianity, deeply rooted itself in\\u00a0the\\u00a0consciousness of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian people.\\nWhen Russia expanded and\\u00a0absorbed other nations who profess Islam, Buddhism and\\u00a0Judaism, Russia has always been very loyal to\\u00a0those people who profess other religions. This is her strength. This is absolutely clear.\\nAnd\\u00a0the\\u00a0fact is that the\\u00a0main postulates, main values are very similar, not to\\u00a0say the\\u00a0same, in\\u00a0all world religions I\\u2019ve just mentioned and\\u00a0which are the\\u00a0traditional religions of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian Federation, Russia. By\\u00a0the\\u00a0way, Russian authorities were always very careful about the\\u00a0culture and\\u00a0religion of\\u00a0those peoples who came into the\\u00a0Russian Empire. This, in\\u00a0my\\u00a0opinion, forms the\\u00a0basis of\\u00a0both security and\\u00a0stability of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Russian statehood\\u00a0\\u2013 all the\\u00a0peoples inhabiting Russia basically consider it their Motherland.\\nIf, say, people move over to\\u00a0you or\\u00a0to\\u00a0Europe from Latin America\\u00a0\\u2013 an\\u00a0even clearer and\\u00a0more understandable example\\u00a0\\u2013 people come, but yet they have come to\\u00a0you or\\u00a0to\\u00a0European countries from their historical homeland. And\\u00a0people who profess different religions in\\u00a0Russia consider Russia their Motherland, they have no other Motherland. We are together, this is one big family. And\\u00a0our traditional values are very similar. I\\u2019ve just mentioned one big family, but everyone has his/hers own family, and\\u00a0this is the\\u00a0basis of\\u00a0our society. And\\u00a0if we say that the\\u00a0Motherland and\\u00a0the\\u00a0family are specifically connected with each other, it is indeed the\\u00a0case, since it is impossible to\\u00a0ensure a\\u00a0normal future for\\u00a0our children and\\u00a0our families unless we ensure a\\u00a0normal, sustainable future for\\u00a0the\\u00a0entire country, for\\u00a0the\\u00a0Motherland. That is why patriotic sentiment is so strong in\\u00a0Russia.\\nTucker Carlson:\\u00a0Can I\\u00a0say, the\\u00a0one way in\\u00a0which religions are different is that Christianity is specifically a\\u00a0non-violent religion. Jesus says \\u201cTurn the\\u00a0other cheek, don\\u2019t kill\\u201d. How can a\\u00a0leader who has to\\u00a0kill, of\\u00a0any country, how can a\\u00a0leader be a\\u00a0Christian? How do you reconcile that to\\u00a0yourself?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0It is very easy: when it comes to\\u00a0protecting oneself and\\u00a0one\\u2019s family, one\\u2019s homeland. We won\\u2019t attack anyone.\\nWhen did the\\u00a0developments in\\u00a0Ukraine start? Since the\\u00a0coup d\\u2019etat and\\u00a0the\\u00a0hostilities in\\u00a0Donbass began, that\\u2019s when they started. And\\u00a0we are protecting our people, ourselves, our homeland and\\u00a0our future.\\nAs\\u00a0for\\u00a0religion in\\u00a0general.\\nYou know, it\\u2019s not about external manifestations, it\\u2019s not about going to\\u00a0church every day or\\u00a0banging your head on\\u00a0the\\u00a0floor. It is in\\u00a0the\\u00a0heart. And\\u00a0our culture is so human-oriented. Dostoevsky, who is very well known in\\u00a0the\\u00a0West as\\u00a0the\\u00a0genius of\\u00a0Russian culture, Russian literature, spoke a\\u00a0lot about this, about the\\u00a0Russian soul.\\nAfter all, Western society is more pragmatic. Russian people think more about the\\u00a0eternal, about moral values. I\\u00a0don\\u2019t know, maybe you won\\u2019t agree with me, but Western culture is more pragmatic after all.\\nI\\u2019m not saying this is bad, it makes it possible for\\u00a0today\\u2019s \\u201cgolden billion\\u201d to\\u00a0achieve good success in\\u00a0production, even in\\u00a0science, and\\u00a0so on. There\\u2019s nothing wrong with that, I\\u2019m just saying that we kind of\\u00a0look the\\u00a0same, but our minds are built a\\u00a0little differently.\\nTucker Carlson: So do you see the\\u00a0supernatural at\\u00a0work? As\\u00a0you look out across what\\u2019s happening in\\u00a0the\\u00a0world now, do you see God at\\u00a0work? Do you ever think to\\u00a0yourself: these are forces that are not human?\\nVladimir Putin:\\u00a0No, to\\u00a0be honest, I\\u00a0don\\u2019t think so. My\\u00a0opinion is that the\\u00a0development of\\u00a0the\\u00a0world community is in\\u00a0accordance with the\\u00a0inherent laws, and\\u00a0those laws are what they are. It\\u2019s always been this way in\\u00a0the\\u00a0history of\\u00a0mankind. Some nations and\\u00a0countries rose, became stronger and\\u00a0more numerous, and\\u00a0then left the\\u00a0international stage, losing the\\u00a0status they had accustomed to. There is probably no need for\\u00a0me to\\u00a0give examples, but we could start with Genghis Khan and\\u00a0the\\u00a0Horde conquerors, the\\u00a0Golden Horde, and\\u00a0then end with the\\u00a0Roman Empire.\\nIt seems that there has never been anything like the\\u00a0Roman Empire in\\u00a0the\\u00a0history of\\u00a0mankind. Nevertheless, the\\u00a0potential of\\u00a0the\\u00a0barbarians gradually grew, as\\u00a0did their population. In\\u00a0general, the\\u00a0barbarians were getting stronger and\\u00a0began to\\u00a0develop economically, as\\u00a0we would say today. This eventually led to\\u00a0the\\u00a0collapse of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Roman Empire and\\u00a0the\\u00a0regime imposed by\\u00a0the\\u00a0Romans. However, it took five centuries for\\u00a0the\\u00a0Roman Empire to\\u00a0fall apart. The\\u00a0difference with what is happening now is that all the\\u00a0processes of\\u00a0change are happening at\\u00a0a\\u00a0much faster pace than in\\u00a0Roman times.\\nTucker Carlson: So when does the\\u00a0AI empire start do you think?\\nVladimir Putin: (Laughing) You are asking increasingly more complicated questions. To\\u00a0answer them, you need to\\u00a0be an\\u00a0expert in\\u00a0big numbers, big data and\\u00a0AI.\\nMankind is currently facing many threats. Due to\\u00a0genetic researches, it is now possible to\\u00a0create a\\u00a0superhuman, a\\u00a0specialized human being\\u00a0\\u2013 a\\u00a0genetically engineered athlete, scientist, military man.\\nThere are reports that Elon Musk has already had a\\u00a0chip implanted in\\u00a0the\\u00a0human brain in\\u00a0the\\u00a0USA.\\nTucker Carlson: What do you think of\\u00a0that?\\nVladimir Putin: Well, I\\u00a0think there\\u2019s no stopping Elon Musk, he will do as\\u00a0he sees fit. Nevertheless, you need to\\u00a0find some common ground with him, search for\\u00a0ways to\\u00a0persuade him. I\\u00a0think he\\u2019s a\\u00a0smart person, I\\u00a0truly believe he is. So you need to\\u00a0reach an\\u00a0agreement with him because this process needs to\\u00a0be formalized and\\u00a0subjected to\\u00a0certain rules.\\nHumanity has to\\u00a0consider what is going to\\u00a0happen due to\\u00a0the\\u00a0newest developments in\\u00a0genetics or\\u00a0in\\u00a0AI. One can make an\\u00a0approximate prediction of\\u00a0what will happen. Once mankind felt an\\u00a0existential threat coming from nuclear weapons, all nuclear nations began to\\u00a0come to\\u00a0terms with one another since they realized that negligent use of\\u00a0nuclear weaponry could drive humanity to\\u00a0extinction.\\nIt is impossible to\\u00a0stop research in\\u00a0genetics or\\u00a0AI today, just as\\u00a0it was impossible to\\u00a0stop the\\u00a0use of\\u00a0gunpowder back in\\u00a0the\\u00a0day. But as\\u00a0soon as\\u00a0we realize that the\\u00a0threat comes from unbridled and\\u00a0uncontrolled development of\\u00a0AI, or\\u00a0genetics, or\\u00a0any other fields, the\\u00a0time will come to\\u00a0reach an\\u00a0international agreement on\\u00a0how to\\u00a0regulate these things.\\nTucker Carlson: I\\u00a0appreciate all the\\u00a0time you\\u2019ve given us. I\\u00a0just want to\\u00a0ask you one last question and\\u00a0it\\u2019s about someone who is very famous in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States, probably not here. Evan Gershkovich who is the\\u00a0Wall Street Journal reporter, he is 32 and\\u00a0he\\u2019s been in\\u00a0prison for\\u00a0almost a\\u00a0year. This is a\\u00a0huge story in\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States and\\u00a0I\\u00a0just want to\\u00a0ask you directly without getting into details of\\u00a0your version of\\u00a0what happened, if as\\u00a0a\\u00a0sign of\\u00a0your decency you\\u2019ll be willing to\\u00a0release him to\\u00a0us and\\u00a0we\\u2019ll bring him back to\\u00a0the\\u00a0United States?\\nVladimir Putin: We have done so many gestures of\\u00a0goodwill out of\\u00a0decency that I\\u00a0think we have run out of\\u00a0them. We have never seen anyone reciprocate to\\u00a0us in\\u00a0a\\u00a0similar manner. However, in\\u00a0theory, we can say that we do not rule out that we can do that if our partners take reciprocal steps.\\nWhen I\\u00a0talk about the\\u00a0\\u201cpartners\\u201d, I, first of\\u00a0all, refer to\\u00a0special services. Special services are in\\u00a0contact with one another, they are talking about the\\u00a0matter in\\u00a0question. There is no taboo to\\u00a0settle the\\u00a0issue. We are willing to\\u00a0solve it, but there are certain terms being discussed via special services channels. I\\u00a0believe an\\u00a0agreement can be reached.\\nTucker Carlson: So, typically, I\\u00a0mean, this stuff has happened for, obviously, centuries. One country catches other spy within its borders and\\u00a0trades it for\\u00a0one of\\u00a0its own intel guys in\\u00a0other country. I\\u00a0think what makes it, and\\u00a0it\\u2019s not my\\u00a0business, but what makes it different is that this guy is obviously not a\\u00a0spy, he is a\\u00a0kid and\\u00a0maybe he was breaking a\\u00a0law in\\u00a0some way but he is not a\\u00a0superspy and\\u00a0everybody knows that and\\u00a0he has been held hostage and\\u00a0exchange, which is true, with respect, it\\u2019s true and\\u00a0everyone knows it\\u2019s true. So maybe he is in\\u00a0a\\u00a0different category, maybe it\\u2019s not fair to\\u00a0ask for\\u00a0somebody else in\\u00a0exchange for\\u00a0letting him out. Maybe it degrades Russia to\\u00a0do that.\\nVladimir Putin: You know, you can give different interpretations to\\u00a0what constitutes a\\u00a0\\u201cspy\\u201d, but there are certain things provided by\\u00a0law. If a\\u00a0person gets secret information, and\\u00a0does that in\\u00a0a\\u00a0conspiratorial manner, then this is qualified as\\u00a0espionage. And\\u00a0that is exactly what he was doing. He was receiving classified, confidential information, and\\u00a0he did it covertly. Maybe he had been implicated in\\u00a0that, someone could have dragged him into that, maybe he did that out of\\u00a0carelessness, or\\u00a0on\\u00a0his own initiative. Considering the\\u00a0sheer facts, this is qualified as\\u00a0espionage. The\\u00a0fact has been proven, as\\u00a0he was caught red-handed when he was receiving this information. If it had been some far-fetched excuse, some fabrication, something not proven, it would have been a\\u00a0different story then. But he was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting confidential information. What is it, then?\\nTucker Carlson: But are you suggesting he was working for\\u00a0the\\u00a0US government or\\u00a0NATO? Or\\u00a0he was just a\\u00a0reporter who was given material he wasn\\u2019t supposed to\\u00a0have? Those seem like very different, very different things.\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0don\\u2019t know who he was working for. But I\\u00a0would like to\\u00a0reiterate that getting classified information in\\u00a0secret is called espionage, and\\u00a0he was working for\\u00a0the\\u00a0U.S. special services, some other agencies. I\\u00a0don\\u2019t think that he was working for\\u00a0Monaco, as\\u00a0Monaco is hardly interested in\\u00a0getting that information. It is up to\\u00a0the\\u00a0special services to\\u00a0come to\\u00a0an\\u00a0agreement. Some groundwork has been laid. There are people who, in\\u00a0our view, are not connected with special services.\\nLet me tell you a\\u00a0story about a\\u00a0person serving a\\u00a0sentence in\\u00a0an\\u00a0allied country of\\u00a0the\\u00a0U.S. That person, due to\\u00a0patriotic sentiments, eliminated a\\u00a0bandit in\\u00a0one of\\u00a0the\\u00a0European capitals. During the\\u00a0events in\\u00a0the\\u00a0Caucasus, do you know what he [bandit] was doing? I\\u00a0don\\u2019t want to\\u00a0say that, but I\\u00a0will do it anyway. He was laying our soldiers, taken prisoner, on\\u00a0the\\u00a0road and\\u00a0then he drove his car over their heads. What kind of\\u00a0a\\u00a0person is that? Can he be even called a\\u00a0human? But there was a\\u00a0patriot who eliminated him in\\u00a0one of\\u00a0the\\u00a0European capitals. Whether he did that of\\u00a0his own volition or\\u00a0not, that is a\\u00a0different question.\\nTucker Carlson: Evan Gershkovich, that\\u2019s a\\u00a0completely different, I\\u00a0mean, this is a\\u00a0thirty-two year old newspaper reporter.\\nVladimir Putin: He committed something different.\\nTucker Carlson: He is just a\\u00a0journalist\\nVladimir Putin: He is not just a\\u00a0journalist, I\\u00a0reiterate, he is a\\u00a0journalist who was secretly getting confidential information.\\nYes, it is different, but still, I\\u00a0am talking about other people who are essentially controlled by\\u00a0the\\u00a0U.S. authorities wherever they are serving a\\u00a0sentence. There is an\\u00a0ongoing dialogue between the\\u00a0special services. This has to\\u00a0be resolved in\\u00a0a\\u00a0calm, responsible and\\u00a0professional manner. They are keeping in\\u00a0touch, so let them do their work.\\nI\\u00a0do not rule out that the\\u00a0person you referred to, Mister Gershkovich, may return to\\u00a0his motherland. By\\u00a0the\\u00a0end of\\u00a0the\\u00a0day, it does not make any sense to\\u00a0keep him in\\u00a0prison in\\u00a0Russia. We want the\\u00a0U.S. special services to\\u00a0think about how they can contribute to\\u00a0achieving the\\u00a0goals our special services are pursuing. We are ready to\\u00a0talk. Moreover, the\\u00a0talks are underway, and\\u00a0there have been many successful examples of\\u00a0these talks crowned with success. Probably this is going to\\u00a0be crowned with success as\\u00a0well, but we have to\\u00a0come to\\u00a0an\\u00a0agreement.\\nTucker Carlson: I\\u00a0hope you\\u2019ll let him out. Mister President, thank you!\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0also want him to\\u00a0return to\\u00a0his homeland at\\u00a0last. I\\u00a0am absolutely sincere. But let me say once again, the\\u00a0dialogue continues. The\\u00a0more public we render things of\\u00a0this nature, the\\u00a0more difficult it becomes to\\u00a0resolve them. Everything has to\\u00a0be done in\\u00a0a\\u00a0calm manner.\\nTucker Carlson: I\\u00a0wonder if that\\u2019s true with the\\u00a0war though also, I\\u00a0mean, I\\u00a0guess I\\u00a0want to\\u00a0ask one more question which is, and\\u00a0maybe you don\\u2019t want to\\u00a0say so for\\u00a0strategic reasons, but are you worried that what\\u2019s happening in\\u00a0Ukraine could lead to\\u00a0something much larger and\\u00a0much more horrible and\\u00a0how motivated are you just to\\u00a0call the\\u00a0US government and\\u00a0say \\u201clet\\u2019s come to\\u00a0terms\\u201d?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0already said that we did not refuse to\\u00a0talk. We are willing to\\u00a0negotiate. It is the\\u00a0Western side, and\\u00a0Ukraine is obviously a\\u00a0satellite state of\\u00a0the\\u00a0U.S. It is evident. I\\u00a0do not want you to\\u00a0take it as\\u00a0if I\\u00a0am looking for\\u00a0a\\u00a0strong word or\\u00a0an\\u00a0insult, but we both understand what is happening.\\nThe\\u00a0financial support, 72 billion U.S. dollars, was provided. Germany ranks second, then other European countries come. Dozens of\\u00a0billions of\\u00a0U.S. dollars are go to\\u00a0Ukraine. There is a\\u00a0huge influx of\\u00a0weapons.\\nIn\\u00a0this case you should tell the\\u00a0current Ukrainian leadership to\\u00a0stop and\\u00a0come to\\u00a0the\\u00a0negotiating table, rescind this absurd decree. We did not refuse.\\nTucker Carlson: Well, sure, you have already said it\\u00a0\\u2014 I\\u00a0didn\\u2019t think you meant it as\\u00a0an\\u00a0insult\\u00a0\\u2014 because you have already said, correctly, it\\u2019s been reported that Ukraine was prevented from negotiating peace settlement by\\u00a0the\\u00a0former British prime-minister acting on\\u00a0behalf of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Biden administration. Of\\u00a0course, it\\u2019s our satellite, big countries control small countries, that\\u2019s not new. And\\u00a0that is why I\\u00a0asked about dealing directly with the\\u00a0Biden administration, which is making these decisions, not president Zelensky of\\u00a0Ukraine.\\nVladimir Putin: Well, if the\\u00a0Zelensky administration in\\u00a0Ukraine refused to\\u00a0negotiate, I\\u00a0assume that they did it under the\\u00a0instruction from Washington. If Washington believes it to\\u00a0be the\\u00a0wrong decision, let it abandon it, let it find a\\u00a0delicate excuse so that no one is insulted, let it come up with a\\u00a0way out. It was not us who made this decision, it was them, so let them go back on\\u00a0it. That is it.\\nHowever, they made the\\u00a0wrong decision and\\u00a0now we have to\\u00a0look for\\u00a0a\\u00a0way out of\\u00a0this situation, to\\u00a0correct their mistakes. They did it so let them correct it themselves. We support this.\\nTucker Carlson: So, I\\u00a0just want to\\u00a0make sure I\\u00a0am not misunderstanding what you are saying\\u00a0\\u2014 and\\u00a0I\\u00a0don\\u2019t think that I\\u00a0am\\u00a0\\u2014 I\\u00a0think you are saying you want a\\u00a0negotiated settlement to\\u00a0what\\u2019s happening in\\u00a0Ukraine.\\nVladimir Putin: Right. And\\u00a0we made it, we prepared a\\u00a0huge document in\\u00a0Istanbul that was initialed by\\u00a0the\\u00a0head of\\u00a0the\\u00a0Ukrainian delegation. He affixed his signature to\\u00a0some of\\u00a0the\\u00a0provisions, not to\\u00a0all of\\u00a0it. He put his signature and\\u00a0then he himself said: \\u201cWe were ready to\\u00a0sign it and\\u00a0the\\u00a0war would have been over long ago, eighteen months ago. However, Prime Minister Johnson came, talked us out of\\u00a0it and\\u00a0we missed that chance.\\u201d Well, you missed it, you made a\\u00a0mistake, let them get back to\\u00a0that, that is all. Why do we have to\\u00a0bother ourselves and\\u00a0correct somebody else\\u2019s mistakes?\\nI\\u00a0know one can say it is our mistake, it was us who intensified the\\u00a0situation and\\u00a0decided to\\u00a0put an\\u00a0end to\\u00a0the\\u00a0war that started in\\u00a02014 in\\u00a0Donbas, as\\u00a0I\\u00a0have already said, by\\u00a0means of\\u00a0weapons. Let me get back to\\u00a0further in\\u00a0history, I\\u00a0already told you this, we were just discussing it. Let us go back to\\u00a01991 when we were promised that NATO would not be expanded, to\\u00a02008 when the\\u00a0doors to\\u00a0NATO opened, to\\u00a0the\\u00a0Declaration of\\u00a0State Sovereignty of\\u00a0Ukraine declaring Ukraine a\\u00a0neutral state. Let us go back to\\u00a0the\\u00a0fact that NATO and\\u00a0US military bases started to\\u00a0appear on\\u00a0the\\u00a0territory of\\u00a0Ukraine creating threats for\\u00a0us. Let us go back to\\u00a0coup d\\u2019\\u00e9tat in\\u00a0Ukraine in\\u00a02014. It is pointless though, isn\\u2019t it? We may go back and\\u00a0forth endlessly. But they stopped negotiations. Is it a\\u00a0mistake? Yes. Correct it. We are ready. What else is needed?\\nTucker Carlson: Do you think it is too humiliating at\\u00a0this point for\\u00a0NATO to\\u00a0accept Russian control of\\u00a0what was two years ago Ukrainian territory?\\nVladimir Putin: I\\u00a0said let them think how to\\u00a0do it with dignity. There are options if there is a\\u00a0will.\\nUp until now there has been the\\u00a0uproar and\\u00a0screaming about inflicting a\\u00a0strategic defeat on\\u00a0Russia on\\u00a0the\\u00a0battlefield. Now they are apparently coming to\\u00a0realize that it is difficult to\\u00a0achieve, if possible at\\u00a0all. In\\u00a0my\\u00a0opinion, it is impossible by\\u00a0definition, it is never going to\\u00a0happen. It seems to\\u00a0me that now those who are in\\u00a0power in\\u00a0the\\u00a0West have come to\\u00a0realize this as\\u00a0well. If so, if the\\u00a0realization has set in, they have to\\u00a0think what to\\u00a0do next. We are ready for\\u00a0this dialogue.\\nTucker Carlson: Would you be willing to\\u00a0say, \\u201dCongratulations, NATO, you won?\\u201c And\\u00a0just keep the\\u00a0situation where it is now?\\nVladimir Putin: You know, it is a\\u00a0subject matter for\\u00a0the\\u00a0negotiations no one is willing to\\u00a0conduct or, to\\u00a0put it more accurately, they are willing but do not know how to\\u00a0do it. I\\u00a0know they want. It is not just I\\u00a0see it but I\\u00a0know they do want it but they are struggling to\\u00a0understand how to\\u00a0do it. They have driven the\\u00a0situation to\\u00a0the\\u00a0point where we are at. It is not us who have done that, it is our partners, opponents who have done that. Well, now let them think how to\\u00a0reverse the\\u00a0situation. We are not against it.\\nIt would be funny if it were not so sad. This endless mobilization in\\u00a0Ukraine, the\\u00a0hysteria, the\\u00a0domestic problems\\u00a0\\u2013 sooner or\\u00a0later it all will result in\\u00a0an\\u00a0agreement. You know, this will probably sound strange given the\\u00a0current situation but the\\u00a0relations between the\\u00a0two peoples will be rebuilt anyway. It will take a\\u00a0lot of\\u00a0time but they will heal.\\nI\\u00a0will give you very unusual examples. There is a\\u00a0combat encounter on\\u00a0the\\u00a0battlefield, here is a\\u00a0specific example: Ukrainian soldiers got encircled (this is an\\u00a0example from real life), our soldiers were shouting to\\u00a0them: \\u201cThere is no chance! Surrender yourselves! Come out and\\u00a0you will be alive!\\u201d Suddenly the\\u00a0Ukrainian soldiers were screaming from there in\\u00a0Russian, perfect Russian, saying: \\u201cRussians do not surrender!\\u201d and\\u00a0all of\\u00a0them perished. They still identify themselves as\\u00a0Russian.\\nWhat is happening is, to\\u00a0a\\u00a0certain extent, an\\u00a0element of\\u00a0a\\u00a0civil war. Everyone in\\u00a0the\\u00a0West thinks that the\\u00a0Russian people have been split by\\u00a0hostilities forever. No. They will be reunited. The\\u00a0unity is still there.\\nWhy are the\\u00a0Ukranian authorities dismantling the\\u00a0Ukranian Orthodox Church? Because it brings together not only the\\u00a0territory, it brings together our souls. No one will be able to\\u00a0separate the\\u00a0soul.\\nShall we end here or\\u00a0there is anything else?\\nTucker Carlson: Thank you, Mr. President.\\n* * *\\nNOTES\\n1. To verify the historical accuracy of Putin\\u2019s narrative, here\\u2019s a breakdown based on established historical knowledge:\\nFoundation of the Russian State (862): The account of the Varangian prince Rurik being invited to rule in Novgorod around 862 is consistent with traditional Russian history narratives, marking the beginning of what would become the Kievan Rus\\u2019, a federation of Slavic tribes.\\nMove to Kiev by Prince Oleg (882): Prince Oleg\\u2019s move to Kiev and the establishment of it as a political center is historically acknowledged. He is credited with expanding the state and consolidating power, laying the groundwork for the growth of Kievan Rus\\u2019.\\nBaptism of Rus\\u2019 (988): The baptism of Rus\\u2019 under Prince Vladimir in 988 is a significant historical event, marking the beginning of the Christianization of the Rus\\u2019 people and the establishment of Eastern Orthodoxy as the state religion.\\nFragmentation and Mongol Invasion: The fragmentation of Rus\\u2019 into various principalities and the subsequent Mongol invasion led by Batu Khan in the 13th century are well-documented events. The Mongol \\u201cTatar yoke\\u201d indeed resulted in significant destruction and the payment of tribute by the surviving Rus\\u2019 cities.\\nRus\\u2019 and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania: The narrative correctly identifies the southward drift of parts of Rus\\u2019 towards the emerging power of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The incorporation of these lands into the Lithuanian state, followed by the union with Poland and the religious union that partly moved the Orthodox population under the Pope\\u2019s influence, are historical facts.\\nPolonization and the emergence of Ukrainian identity: The process of Polonization and the gradual development of a distinct Ukrainian identity within the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth are complex historical processes. The term \\u201cUkrainian\\u201d historically referred to residents of the borderlands (\\u201ckrai\\u201d), but the development of a national identity was influenced by various socio-political factors over centuries, not solely by Polish influence.\\n2. Pereyaslav Agreement (1654) and its consequences: The reference to the 1654 agreement, where certain Ukrainian territories sought the protection of the Tsardom of Muscovy to escape Polish dominion, aligns with historical records. The subsequent wars between Russia and Poland and the eventual division of territories are accurately depicted.\\n3. Role of Catherine the Great and expansion of the Russian Empire: Catherine the Great\\u2019s reign saw significant territorial expansions, including parts of modern-day Ukraine, which is correctly stated.\\n4. Ukrainian National Movement and the 19th Century: The emergence of a Ukrainian national identity and independence movements in the 19th century is a complex topic. While there were indeed movements advocating for Ukrainian independence or autonomy, the portrayal of these movements and their relationship with Russia varies in different historical narratives.\\n5.\\u00a0The information Putin provided contains several points that require clarification and correction for historical accuracy. Let\\u2019s address these points systematically:\\nPoland\\u2019s collaboration with Hitler and partitioning of Czechoslovakia: It is not accurate to describe Poland\\u2019s actions before World War II as \\u201ccollaborating\\u201d with Hitler in the same manner as, for example, Italy or Japan. While it\\u2019s true that Poland participated in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement by annexing a small part of Czechoslovakia (the Zaolzie region) in October 1938, this was more a matter of seizing an opportunistic territorial gain rather than a collaboration with Nazi Germany. The annexation of Zaolzie was motivated by Poland\\u2019s own territorial disputes with Czechoslovakia, not by a cooperative policy with Germany.\\nDanzig Corridor and the outbreak of World War II: The issue of the Danzig Corridor and the city of Danzig (now Gda\\u0144sk, Poland) were indeed major points of contention between Poland and Germany. However, the narrative that Poland \\u201cpushed Hitler to start World War II\\u201d by refusing to cede the Danzig Corridor is misleading. Hitler\\u2019s ambitions were much larger than just rectifying perceived territorial injustices. His goals included the destruction of Poland as a sovereign state and the subjugation of Eastern Europe as part of his broader Lebensraum (living space) policy. The refusal to cede the Danzig Corridor and Danzig was more of a trigger or pretext for the invasion, not the cause of World War II.\\nUSSR\\u2019s role and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact: The description of the USSR\\u2019s behavior as \\u201cvery honest\\u201d in the context of its proposed assistance to Czechoslovakia is highly controversial and misleading. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in August 1939, included secret protocols dividing Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence. This pact directly enabled the start of World War II by assuring that Germany would not face a two-front war upon invading Poland. Following the pact, both Germany and the Soviet Union invaded Poland in September 1939, leading to its partition between the two aggressors.\\nPost-war territorial changes: The statement about Russia (USSR) regaining its \\u201chistorical lands\\u201d and the post-war territorial adjustments is partially accurate but requires context. After World War II, the borders of Poland were indeed redrawn. The USSR annexed significant portions of eastern Poland, while Poland received territories from Germany, leading to the westward shift of Poland\\u2019s borders. This resulted in the expulsion and forced resettlement of millions of people. While it\\u2019s true that Poland gained access to the Baltic Sea and the city of Danzig was returned to Poland (and renamed Gda\\u0144sk), these changes were part of broader, often violent, population transfers and territorial adjustments dictated by the victorious Allied powers, primarily the USSR, the United States, and the United Kingdom.\\nIn summary, while there are elements of truth in the provided account, it simplifies and misrepresents complex historical events and motivations. The onset of World War II and the subsequent territorial and political changes in Eastern Europe were the result of actions and policies by multiple states, including aggressive expansionism by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, and cannot be attributed to the actions of Poland alone.\\n6. 20th Century Events: Putin\\u2019s overview of 20th-century events, including the role of Austria-Hungary, World War I, the Bolsheviks, and the creation of the Soviet Union, simplifies complex historical dynamics. The creation of Soviet Ukraine and the policies of \\u201cUkrainianization\\u201d are broadly correct, but the nuances of these processes are subject to scholarly debate.\\nPost-World War II changes and the creation of the USSR\\u2019s boundaries: The adjustments to Ukraine\\u2019s borders after World War II, including territories from Poland, Hungary, and Romania, are accurately described. The Soviet policy of establishing Ukraine as a Soviet republic with specific territories, including those with no historical connection to Ukraine, reflects Stalin\\u2019s broader territorial reconfigurations in Eastern Europe.\\nAssertion of Ukraine as an \\u201cartificial state\\u201d: This statement is controversial and reflects a perspective that is not universally accepted. The concept of \\u201cartificiality\\u201d in state formation is a subject of debate among historians. Nations and states often emerge through complex processes of negotiation, war, and political agreements, making the categorization of any state as \\u201cartificial\\u201d highly subjective and politically charged.\\nPutin simplifies and condenses a highly complex history of Rus\\u2019, Ukraine, and Russia\\u2019s development and relationships with neighboring powers. While the core events mentioned are based on historical records, the interpretation of these events, especially concerning national identity and the framing of historical narratives, can vary significantly depending on the source. The historical context provided is broadly accurate but presented from a perspective that emphasizes a continuous Russian statehood and influence over Ukraine\\u2019s territories, reflecting a specific viewpoint on the centuries-long history shared and contested by Russians, Ukrainians, and other regional actors.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nInterviews, Russo-Ukrainian War, Tucker Carlson, Vladimir Putin \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLeave a Comment Cancel ReplyYour email address will not be published.

When her first book, I Lost It at the Movies (1965), and her 1968 appointment as a movie critic for The New Yorker brought her national prominence, some people raised eyebrows, others glasses, to her revolutionary style.\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nShe Lost It at the Movies\\nInterview conducted by Susan Goodman\\nDay One: Sitting in the living room of Pauline Kael\\u2019s home in western Massachusetts, I asked her if editors ever pressured her about her movie reviews. She described an encounter with The New Yorker\\u2019s legendary editor, William Shawn. After Shawn read her pan of Terrence Malick\\u2019s movie Badlands, he said, \\u201cI guess you didn\\u2019t know that Terry is like a son to me.\\u201d\\nKael\\u2019s response: \\u201cTough shit.\\u201d\\nDay Two: I returned for our second conversation, and Kael said she had been thinking of the Shawn story. I started to fret\\u2014she wants to retract it, I thought. Instead she said, \\u201cIf you use that story, what I actually said was, \\u2018Tough shit, Bill.\\u2019\\u201d\\nPauline Kael has brought the same fierce passion, independence, and incisiveness to her movie reviews since she took on Charlie Chaplin\\u2019s Limelight in 1952. When her first book, I Lost It at the Movies (1965), and her 1968 appointment as a movie critic for The New Yorker brought her national prominence, some people raised eyebrows, others glasses, to her revolutionary style.\\nKael unabashedly loved movies, be they trash or highbrow, as long as they grabbed for life and originality. Unlike most critics, she used herself as an instrument, analyzing her own reactions to orchestrate a deeper understanding of film. Fortunately, this instrument had rich tone and resonance. Kael could position a movie properly within film history, link it with other arts, and nestle it firmly into cultural context.\\nDespite detractors as rabid as her fans, Kael won a Guggenheim and her fourth book, Deeper Into Movies (1973), was the first about film to receive a National Book Award. When she retired in 1991, she was the movie critic. And to many, she still is. In fact, some readers\\u2014even fellow critics\\u2014believe she has a private screening room in the Pantheon.\\nReading Kael makes you think, which leads to a greater understanding of what you\\u2019ve seen, whether or not you agree with her opinion. Talking to Kael also makes you think, as I discovered during our two days of conversation. You end up knowing a movie or a performance better, as well as your own reaction to it. When she says, \\u201cTommy Lee Jones has the least camera-happy face. His eyes are sunken, so the camera doesn\\u2019t illuminate much in the upper part of his face,\\u201d you think, Ah, that\\u2019s yet another reason his performances put me on edge. She comments, \\u201cAmateurs singing old standards spur instant and unfavorable comparisons to the greats\\u201d and you realize that\\u2019s probably why Woody Allen avoided the \\u201930s\\u2019 most famous songs in Everyone Says I Love You.\\nKael\\u2019s views come wrapped in language so mercilessly precise, so sharp, that it has cut many an actor and director. In conversation, however, these words are often delivered with a buffering warmth that can\\u2019t be seen on the page.\\n* * *\\nMODERN MATURITY: Did you always have strong opinions about movies?\\nPAULINE KAEL: I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at Kentucky Moonshine, a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to another movie again. I also broke up with somebody after I wrote about West Side Story. It\\u2019s very difficult to disagree on a date.\\nMM: Certainly the first couple of dates.\\nKAEL: On the other hand, one of the awful things about married couples is the way they often agree about movies. It drives me crazy listening to them. One of the worst aspects of marriage is when people lose their independent judgment in politics, the arts, life in general.\\nMM: Do you ever use people\\u2019s opinions of movies as a litmus test about whether to be friends?\\nKAEL: Sometimes I think I could never be friends with somebody who didn\\u2019t like a movie I loved.\\nThen I think, what the hell, it\\u2019s only a movie. Still, it\\u2019s hard for me to like somebody who hates McCabe & Mrs. Miller or The Earrings of Madame de\\u2026\\nMM: When you make such a statement, who in his right mind would tell you his opinion?\\nKAEL: I\\u2019m not that intimidating in person. Anyway, people like to disagree with me. I made one of my first friends in New York when he asked if he could take me home from a party where men had been jumping on my opinions all night. They had to show they knew better.\\nMM: It seems you and your writing have evoked great controversy. Is there any particular reason why? Do you think you\\u2019ve gotten so much flak because you\\u2019re a woman?\\nKAEL: Well, the president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences once did call me \\u201ca miserable bitch.\\u201d But generally it was because I didn\\u2019t agree with the consensus of criticism that had formed about a movie. This cycle usually begins with a studio\\u2019s marketing department and wends to the press. By the time a movie is authenticated in The New York Times, it\\u2019s accepted as a wonderful work. Then if my review says, \\u201cThis is a pathetic tissue of moldy ideas,\\u201d it deeply offends those who came out for it.\\nAlso, most movies I cared about didn\\u2019t get good reviews. Bonnie and Clyde, Mean Streets, even The Godfather initially did not get good press. Now critics refer to them as classics and don\\u2019t say what their original opinion was.\\nMM: You were perceived as someone who could literally make or break a movie.\\nKAEL: That was a goofy perception. But movie companies did bar me from screenings\\u2014they thought I was influencing other critics even though I never talked to them about a movie before they reviewed it. But I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They\\u2019ve rarely agreed with me about movies.\\nMM: Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.\\n\\n\\n\\nKAEL: I hate it. It is very creepy being imitated.\\nMM: Do you think your criticism has changed movies or affected filmmakers?\\nKAEL: I\\u2019d rather not say. If I say yes, I\\u2019m an egotist, and if I say no, I\\u2019ve wasted my life. Although I\\u2019ve been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy. MM: What was your goal when writing criticism?\\nKAEL: I aimed for something more than just an opinion\\u2014to evoke a movie and its qualities, to indicate where it falters and where it succeeds, to know what the movie is really about and what it means to people. For example, Dirty Harry was emotionally effective even though it created all sorts of right\\u00adwing fantasies.\\nMM: You once wrote, \\u201cIf you think it is so easy to be a critic, so difficult to be a poet . . . may I suggest you try both? You may discover why there are so few critics, so many poets.\\u201d Did you mean it?\\nKAEL: It\\u2019s hard to be a good critic. Many today want to kid around on the order of Siskel and Ebert\\u2014at least those two have some taste. I see young critics now who are hopeless idiots but are good looking and grand in manner\\u2014and I giggle every time I see them.\\nMM: What\\u2019s your opinion of TV critics?\\nKAEL: If you trust them, you have a hole in your head.\\nMM: Why?\\nKAEL: They critique on the basis of what they think the audience will like, not what they like. I\\u2019ve known critics on reputable papers who admitted they didn\\u2019t like something they praised on television because that\\u2019s what the editor wanted or what the people expected.\\nMM: So you don\\u2019t think any TV critics are worth listening to?\\nKAEL: Name one.\\nMM: How about Michael Medved, who judges movies using family values as a yardstick?\\nKAEL: I try not to think about Michael Medved.\\nMM: John Simon once said that the first and last responsibility of the film critic is to raise the standard of movies.\\nKAEL: Bull. What is the standard to be raised? Movies should give pleasure, pleasure that encompasses sensibility and excitement. People like that always get exercised about interesting movies, like Last Tango in Paris. I was surprised at how few angry letters I got from readers after my favorable review, considering that practically every critic jumped down my throat. Very few people I know didn\\u2019t like Last Tango.\\nMM: What do you say to people who claim you\\u2019re obsessed by sex and violence?\\nKAEL: That\\u2019s what movies are about.\\nMM: Should kids see sex on the screen?\\nKAEL: I don\\u2019t think sex gets to kids very much. They don\\u2019t understand what\\u2019s going on. Actually, movies are a good place to learn about sex. You learn about romance. You learn how to behave in certain situations. You learn when to be wary and when to be gung-ho.\\nMM: An example?\\nKAEL: Oh, almost any movie with Clark Gable, or those other sturdy men, told us which kinds of men we should be careful with and which were true blue. Movies are our passport into an adult world and help us understand that world better.\\nMM: What about screen violence? Is any of it objectionable?\\nKAEL: Violence that makes you identify with the killer. There\\u2019s a lot of violence at the beginning of Grand Illusion, but you\\u2019re appalled by it. Bonnie and Clyde suffered for their indifference and casualness about using weapons. Whereas in a Clint Eastwood movie, you identify with the guy with the biggest gun, not the victim. That\\u2019s a big difference emotionally. Natural Born Killers is a horrible movie\\u2014the victims are made ludicrous and pathetic, so you\\u2019re supposed to cheer the killers on.\\nMM: It\\u2019s hardly surprising you hated that movie, considering its director. I read in The New York Times that when you retired you quipped, \\u201cThe prospect of having to sit through another Oliver Stone movie is too much.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nKAEL: I despise his movies. If you care about movie art, there are certain people whom it\\u2019s legitimate to despise. JFK and Nixon are historically so dubious and yet accepted by audiences as accurate. All you can do as a critic is point out the distortions.\\nMM: Have you ever walked out of a movie?\\nKAEL: I\\u2019ve walked out on movies I found hopeless. Harold Pinter\\u2019s Betrayal drove me crazy\\u2014people talking in these precise phrases over and over again. Fellini\\u2019s Casanova drove me out of the movie house, and I said so in my review. Damned if people didn\\u2019t say I should go back and see the rest, as if it were a duty to be bored. I mean, you\\u2019re still a human being, even if you are a critic.\\nMM: Is it true you see movies only once?\\nKAEL: I react with all my senses the first time. The second time, it becomes academic. And once I write about a movie, it stays fixed in my mind so I\\u2019ve never had any desire to rent the video.\\nMM: I\\u2019ve heard you never change your mind about a movie. Is that because you\\u2019ve never seen one twice?\\nKAEL: Who changes his mind about a movie? That\\u2019s something you expect critics to do because it sounds open-minded. Maybe they just get influenced by public opinion. When I wrote about John Cassavetes\\u2019s later pictures, I looked at my reviews of his earlier ones. I was writing almost exactly the same things. His pictures hadn\\u2019t changed and I hadn\\u2019t changed.\\nMM: Did you have any ground rules as a critic?\\nKAEL: I never let anybody tell me what I should write.\\nMM: Even when an editor says \\u2026\\nKAEL: Even by inflection. You don\\u2019t let an editor suggest what your tone should be. You don\\u2019t let him or her suggest it by the tone in which he or she urges you to see it. If an editor encourages you to see something, there\\u2019s always something involved, whether it\\u2019s advertising or a desire to please the audience. Yet the critic\\u2019s worst corruption is a desire to keep the readers happy, praising movies the mass audience is going to love, like Twister or Independence Day.\\nMM: Many believed you lost a contract with McCall\\u2019s over a pan of The Sound of Music, which you dubbed The Sound of Money. Did you ever get pressure at The New Yorker?\\nKAEL: Not so much. William Shawn was a great editor who gave you time and space, but he also fought for a certain tone. He wanted me to be ladylike and made me feel I was breaking his heart if I used language he didn\\u2019t approve of. He thought he was holding the line against the barbarians.\\nHe did outwit me once, though, when I wanted to write about Deep Throat. He was ill and sprung his heart troubles on me, so I gave in on that one.\\nMM: Did you avoid making friends in the movie business because it would be hard to review them?\\nKAEL: I only spoke with actors or directors if they contacted me after a movie was out. Barbra Streisand called me after I panned Funny Lady to tell me that she agreed with me.\\nMM: Rumor has it Streisand solicited your opinion on The Prince of Tides before its release.\\nKAEL: She phoned me afterwards to ask what I thought. I was very rough.\\nMM: You didn\\u2019t want to let her down easy?\\nKAEL: Barbra Streisand doesn\\u2019t need to be let down easy.\\nMM: When you see movies that could have been great, don\\u2019t you wish you could have been a bug in the director\\u2019s ear during filming?\\nKAEL: All the time. The first half of Conspiracy Theory was terrific, then it went to hell. Movies often start with a fascinating situation that they don\\u2019t know how to resolve.\\nMM: Why is that so common?\\nKAEL: Stories used to have happy, romantic endings, but now you can\\u2019t do that or people will puke\\u2014 unless it\\u2019s about a homosexual couple, in which case a happy ending is allowed. So they have to keep the lovers apart, but still offer some hope to keep you from storming the theater.\\nMM: You talk about what moviemakers can and can\\u2019t do now. Is Hollywood reflecting our taste or creating it?\\n\\n\\n\\nKAEL: We often settle for what they give us\\u2014witness what people watch on television. They sell us what they think we want and we buy it because we want to go to the movies. Other, smaller things, are out there we just don\\u2019t hear about. That\\u2019s where critics come in\\u2014or, should.\\nMM: One of your favorite movie companions has been your grandson. Did you ever restrict his viewing?\\nKAEL: I took him to things kids weren\\u2019t supposed to see. Earlier generations went to see what was forbidden in life and developed a real excitement about the movies. Today\\u2019s rating system keeps kids out of the good ones. I wouldn\\u2019t want them to see movies like Natural Born Killers, but my tendency is you\\u2019re better off seeing things than not. That glazed indifference kids develop can be worse than over-excitement.\\nMM: You got a close look at Hollywood in 1979 when you consulted for Paramount. How come you didn\\u2019t stay long?\\nKAEL: I was dying to leave after a few months; I missed writing terribly. Also, you see all the arrogance and the money- and honor-chasing. You find part of what makes someone a director is an amalgam of qualities not desirable in the home.\\nMM: Such as?\\nKAEL: Directors are very manipulative people. They have the opportunity to be cruel and domineering, and can\\u2019t resist it. I once heard John Ford speak at an event. The moderator was a professor who was so excited to be presiding at a John Ford event, but overdressed badly for the occasion. Ford went over to him and ostentatiously felt his nubby raw silk material. The humiliation he inflicted made me just hate Ford momentarily.\\nDirectors are also fawned over and surrounded by a whole entourage. You\\u2019re terribly aware whenever one is in a group; he holds his seat differently.\\nMM: Like he\\u2019s holding court?\\nKAEL: That\\u2019s right. And there\\u2019s also the role that drugs and sex play. I mean, directors can get just about any girl they set their sights on. And if they don\\u2019t have time to look for themselves, they have pimps scouting for them. The presence of pimps in a social setting can be very unpleasant.\\nMM: Do you mean \\u201cpimps\\u201d literally?\\nKAEL: Literally.\\nMM: What about the other members of the moviemaking team?\\nKAEL: Writers have very little power, but are very amiable and like to sit up all night talking about movies. For the most part, producers are no longer on set taking care of troubles. Rich businessmen often become producers to date movie stars\\u2014or to get their names in the titles and take a cut.\\nMM: What were you hoping to do in Hollywood?\\nKAEL: Produce movies the way they should be produced, but I didn\\u2019t have the patience for it. You go over a script a dozen times and the first version was generally better than the one you end up with. Everything is subject to negotiations, and the people you want are tied up or want to work with someone else. It just becomes too complex.\\nMM: Is it really worse now than under the studio system?\\nKAEL: The studio system was lethal, but what\\u2019s happening now isn\\u2019t so hot either. Studios consider $20 million dollar movies throwaway packages because they don\\u2019t have big stars. Buying advertising time on TV costs an incredible amount so they won\\u2019t promote small pictures. That\\u2019s why you don\\u2019t hear anything about movies like Looking for Richard and Before the Rain.\\nMM: How can we surmount this problem?\\nKAEL: I thought it was possible about 20 years ago because there were directors with such strengths and idealism. They could have created the new system of distribution required, but they didn\\u2019t. Now they\\u2019ve become so insanely rich and successful\\u2014at least Lucas and Spielberg\\u2014it\\u2019s hopeless to expect them to change at heart and pocketbook.\\nMaybe a new wave somewhere will affect American films the way the French New Wave affected them in the 60s. It\\u2019s also possible that imagination and fantasy and realism, these things that sustain movies, will all go down the drain.\\nMM: More stars are becoming directors now. Is that wise?\\nKAEL: Often they give up their greatest talent. Sean Penn is a perfectly good director, but he\\u2019s a superb actor. Mel Gibson, stunningly good in Conspiracy Theory, is a much finer actor than director.\\nMost of the time, the big stars are a little too old. Directing is something people do best when they\\u2019re young, with the possible exceptions of Vittorio de Sica and Luis Bu\\u00f1uel. When you\\u2019re young, you use all your senses and have the deviltry to do something new that will affect an audience deeply. Spielberg doesn\\u2019t do now what he did as a young man. He did crazy, goofy things. Jaws was a great comedy; in E.T., he let his childhood feelings inform the material in a direct way. But Hook was deadly, no child\\u2019s imagination left in it. Schindler\\u2019s List is a work of feeling, but planned feeling.\\nWhen you\\u2019re young, you\\u2019re not hemmed in by big production money. You\\u2019re protecting your credit card; later, you\\u2019re protecting your swimming pool. That\\u2019s a big difference. Also, you no longer know what music is hot. Your visual daring isn\\u2019t the same. You use expensive cinematographers instead of young ones who want to do something fresh. Everything becomes safer and more extravagant as you get older.\\n\\n\\n\\nMM: You once said you weren\\u2019t impressed with Ingmar Bergman because you\\u2019d done your share of soul-wrestling and it wasn\\u2019t that tough. What\\u2019s the hardest type of movie to do right?\\nKAEL: Films like Renoir\\u2019s Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game are terribly difficult to achieve because they seem to unfold right in front of you. E.T.\\u2019s spontaneity and the good Robert Altman films\\u2014Vincent & Theo, M*A*S*H, Thieves Like Us\\u2014are harder to do than a David Lean picture where all the effects are orchestrated. These directors felt out what they wanted, then improvised.\\nIn these circumstances, real artists come up with surprises. Sean Penn and Michael J. Fox had scenes together in Brian De Palma\\u2019s Casualties of War unlike anything they\\u2019ve done before. And you know it was a discovery for the director and the actors as well as for you\\u2014that\\u2019s the kind of thing you dream of.\\nMM: Do you ever cry at movies?\\nKAEL: No, but I choke up at the obvious things. Children and animals in peril get to me. In My Left Foot, I choked up when Christy found out his therapist was getting married, and not to him.\\nMM: What kind of movies are you sick of?\\nKAEL: For a while, I couldn\\u2019t stand any more sentimental movies. Now it\\u2019s action movies. I expected to love the Cage-Travolta interplay in Face/Off, but it was poorly conceived\\u2014I don\\u2019t care if I ever see another one by John Woo. I need a vacation from gunshots. Moviemaking is so male-dominated now that they think they\\u2019re being profeminine when they have women punching each other out.\\nMM: In Deeper Into Movies, you described movies as a \\u201csupremely pleasurable and dangerous art form. \\u201cI get the pleasurable part, but what\\u2019s so dangerous?\\nKAEL: At a movie house, you feel alone with the image and you\\u2019re affected deeply. The different elements that go into movies\\u2014music, cinematography, actors, design\\u2014get to you very strongly.\\nThat\\u2019s why so many educated people disapprove of movies; they\\u2019re not used to giving themselves over to that much emotion. They prefer the distance they can keep in legitimate theater.\\nMM: Is that why so-called intellectuals often prefer European films?\\nKAEL: Yes, and they associate greatness with foreign films. We tend to think of art as European; there\\u2019s an embarrassment about art in America. But The Godfather changed that for a lot of people. When The Godfather II came out and you got the full dimensions of that family, you had a hard time not using the word \\u201cgreat.\\u201d Still, I think educated people feel more at home with Czech and Australian films full of humane little lessons.\\nMM: You dislike humane little lessons?\\nKAEL: Lessons are for television movies about homosexuality or somebody\\u2019s sickness; that\\u2019s why they\\u2019re so boring. In & Out got wrecked when all the townsfolk backed the gay teacher\\u2014it was like Frank Capra solidarity; the message was too clear. Steve Martin turned down that role and, essentially, he was right.\\nMM: What do you feel have been some of the best and worst examples of casting in movie history?\\nKAEL: I used to play that game when I was younger. I hate talking about that stuff because it fetishizes movies and movie lore.\\nMM: Aw, c\\u2019mon. Gregory Peck as Captain Ahab\\u2026?\\nKAEL: Wasn\\u2019t that an atrocity. . . . All right, Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman was superb casting\\u2014a movie you knew was trash but you enjoyed it thoroughly. Trash redeemed. The interplay between Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in The Rock made that movie just about worth watching. In fact, Sean Connery in just about any movie redeems the scenes he\\u2019s in.\\nMM: He clearly has star presence. What is it exactly?\\nKAEL: A magnetic personality. Extraordinary beauty, often unusual beauty. And talent.\\nMM: Who, besides Connery, has it? Whose work do you always try to see?\\nKAEL: Paul Newman becomes more glamorous with years, like Cary Grant. Nicholas Cage is an unusual actor. Travolta\\u2019s heartfelt quality cuts through the falsest material, and Brando is still uniquely imaginative. Bruce Willis is a much better actor than he\\u2019s given credit for. John Cusack, Morgan Freeman, Nick Nolte, Denzel Washington. Tom Hanks, of course. I\\u2019d also include some fine actors who often take parts that don\\u2019t suit them\\u2014Robert Duvall, Al Pacino, and Tommy Lee Jones.\\nMM: And women?\\nKAEL: Michelle Pfeiffer. Anjelica Huston. Sigourney Weaver. Debra Winger, if she\\u2019d come back and act. Diane Keaton has done extraordinary work. She was fabulous in Crimes of the Heart. So was Jessica Lange.\\nMM: Why does your list include so many more men than women?\\nKAEL: The movies we\\u2019re given just don\\u2019t have interesting parts for women to shine in. Although recently Chasing Amy and Flirting With Disaster had some good female roles.\\nMM: You have no foreign actors on your list. What about a strong guy like Gerard Depardieu?\\nKAEL: In his earlier roles he was unusually sensitive, but now he just proves a man can be shaped like a beer barrel and still play a leading role.\\nMM: Which underrated actors do you wish you saw more?\\nKAEL: Michael Keaton, who was wonderful in Beetlejuice, has many qualities that have been forgotten because he hasn\\u2019t been in anything good for a while. And Judy Davis has given performances, like the one in Woody Allen\\u2019s Husbands and Wives, that just belt me out of the chair. She\\u2019s got everything except the roles.\\nMM: Which duos have had the best sexual chemistry?\\nKAEL: Margaret Sullavan and James Stewart in their early movies like Next Time We Love and The Shop Around the Corner. They made about four pictures together that were fearlessly delicate.\\nMM: Who\\u2019s hard to match up romantically?\\nKAEL: Dustin Hoffman. I don\\u2019t get Demi Moore, do you? And Tom Cruise, who would you put him with? Robert De Niro was sexy in Mean Streets, but he\\u2019s lost it. He should never have gotten fat and squared down. He\\u2019s never been the same. And I\\u2019d say Joan Allen plays Pat Nixon all too well.\\nMM: Are people of color experiencing more opportunities in Hollywood today?\\nKAEL: I think it\\u2019s a case of talent will out, and it \\u201couts\\u201d more now than in earlier periods. A lot of white people enjoyed Eddie Murphy in The Nutty Professor. You don\\u2019t think of Denzel Washington as a black actor but as an actor.\\nMM: What movie era do you consider the finest?\\nKAEL: The \\u201970s.\\nMM: Not the \\u201930s or \\u201940s?\\nKAEL: They used to say that, but the \\u201970s had movies like Shampoo, McCabe & Mrs. Miller, M*A*S*H, The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Mean Streets, and Taxi Driver. That was a pretty good period.\\nMM: How have the \\u201990s movies held up?\\nKAEL: Not very well. Conglomerate financing means you get big action films. They\\u2019re the safest; they travel internationally and work with an illiterate or subliterate audience. But special effects don\\u2019t reflect what\\u2019s going on in a culture. There is a \\u201clostness\\u201d in the air that isn\\u2019t in our movies.\\nMM: One cultural icon coming up in March is the Oscars. Will you be watching on Monday night?\\nKAEL: Sure. But I\\u2019ve managed to write about movies for a lifetime without ever writing about the Academy Awards. That\\u2019s a great source of pride.\\nMM: So you hate them?\\nKAEL: I can\\u2019t be said to hate them. I just think they\\u2019re irrelevant to criticism. Generally they\\u2019re just a popularity contest, but the Oscars are also a great spectacle full of irony and satire.\\nMM: Humphrey Bogart once suggested that the five nominees for best actor give Hamlet\\u2019s soliloquy before the voters. Wouldn\\u2019t that be fairer than trying to compare performances?\\nKAEL: How could you judge actors by their recitation of Hamlet? They may be the wrong physical or emotional type. Bogart himself would have been a hopeless Hamlet.\\nMM: So how would you improve the system?\\nKAEL: It is what it is. Besides, it\\u2019s much more fun to bitch about it and look at the clothes.\\n\\n\\n\\nMM: One of the fun things is seeing which stars seem to be growing \\u201cyounger\\u201d instead of older.\\nKAEL: We generally feel good when we see people our own age on stage or screen because they look terrific and it gives us hope. But it\\u2019s also comic because we know it\\u2019s not natural.\\nMM: What about someone like Diane Keaton, who appears to have aged naturally?\\nKAEL: She seems older than she is because we\\u2019re used to people looking young for so long. But she\\u2019s also wonderful to look at because there are some wrinkles there.\\nMM: She\\u2019s more like us.\\nKAEL: Yes, but \\u201cus\\u201d are being remade, too. I have mixed feeling about plastic surgery. It\\u2019s fun to see someone looking spectacular, but I\\u2019m also appalled when I see people worked over because they don\\u2019t have an expressive acting face; they can\\u2019t move their facial muscles anymore. And they all look alike. There was a period when noses all seemed to be produced by the same surgeon. Now everybody\\u2019s cheeks are pulled the same way. At least it creates more character roles for those who still have their own faces.\\nMM: Why aren\\u2019t actors today allowed to age?\\nKAEL: They never were. Lillian Gish aged onscreen but few others turned old. We develop such an identification with people that it hurts to see them falling apart. I had such beautiful memories of Bette Davis from Jezebel and Marked Woman, but seeing her look dragonish was hard to take. And I would have been just as happy not to have seen Katharine Hepburn in her condition playing that stupid role in Love Affair.\\nMM: Will aging Boomers make it more acceptable for actors to age?\\nKAEL: Today\\u2019s actors are already older than they used to be. Studios used to have stables of young up- and-comers, but now you have to attract attention through an agent and it takes longer. Also, roles are different. We have fewer romantic comedies that you have to be 20 for. And the big box-office stars are in their 40s and 50s, so stories are focusing on older people whether that\\u2019s overt or not.\\nMM: Was age ever a concern for you as a critic?\\nKAEL: I worried about repeating myself. When I quit in \\u201991, I felt I had nothing new to say. Old critics tend to become tiresome, and I didn\\u2019t want to be one of those old farts.\\nMM: Was Parkinson\\u2019s a factor in your retiring?\\nKAEL: I\\u2019ve had it about 15 years, but it started to really give me trouble in 1990. You can\\u2019t go shaking to screenings. I also froze in line a few times, things like that.\\nMM: Are there any recent movies you regret not being able to review?\\nKAEL: Mainly I worry about the little ones that got away. A few years ago when I saw Vanya on 42nd Street, I wanted to blow trumpets. Your trumpets are gone once you\\u2019ve quit.\\nMM: Do you still feel the same excitement when you go to the movies?\\nKAEL: I do when I see something I like. And now Parkinson\\u2019s makes me shake with excitement even more. [Laughs.] After years of being disappointed with stories, you get to a point where you\\u2019re satisfied by just a performance. A few scenes by Bill Murray can rescue a movie. Jim Carrey has practically kept movies alive the past few years. But most comedians lose it after a while. They go on trying to be funny and it becomes ghastly. If Carrey can sustain it, it would be amazing.\\nMM: In a long marriage, the relationship changes as each partner\\u2019s knowledge and feelings about the other change. How has your \\u201crelationship\\u201d with movies changed over time?\\nKAEL: In front of the screen, I\\u2019m still a kid. Movie love is abiding throughout life. The movies have a fascination that our ordinary lives don\\u2019t have. The people are more beautiful, the vistas more splendid.\\nWhen the lights go down, we want to be charmed and entertained. We\\u2019re lovers who are let down all the time, and go on loving.\\nMM: When I\\u2019m at the movies, I feel like I\\u2019m swept up, lost.\\nKAEL: I feel as if I\\u2019m found.\\n\\u2014Susan Goodman is a contributing editor for Modern Maturity.\\nModern Maturity, March-April 1998, pp. 48-52, 80.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore:\\n\\nInterviews, Pauline Kael \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSHARE THIS ARTICLE \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t3 thoughts on \\u201cINTERVIEW WITH PAULINE KAEL (MODERN MATURITY)\\u201d\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJeffrey Zanker 05/07/2020 at 15:26  \\n\\n\\nLiking the Kael interview posts.
